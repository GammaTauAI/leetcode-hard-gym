Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

8,String to Integer (atoi),"Implement the `myAtoi(string s)` function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s `atoi` function).

The algorithm for `myAtoi(string s)` is as follows:
Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.

Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is `'-'` or `'+'`. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.

Read in next the characters until the next non-digit charcter or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.

Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. `""123"" -> 123`, `""0032"" -> 32`). If no digits were read, then the integer is `0`. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).

If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than `-231` should be clamped to `-231`, and integers greater than `231 - 1` should be clamped to `231 - 1`.

Return the integer as the final result.

Note:
Only the space character `' '` is considered a whitespace character.

Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""42""
Output: 42
Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.

Step 1: ""42"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""42"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""42"" (""42"" is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.

Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.


Example 2:
Input: s = ""   -42""
Output: -42
Explanation:
Step 1: ""   -42"" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: ""   -42"" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: ""   -42"" (""42"" is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.

Since -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.


Example 3:
Input: s = ""4193 with words""
Output: 4193
Explanation:
Step 1: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""4193 with words"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""4193 with words"" (""4193"" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.

Since 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.


Example 4:
Input: s = ""words and 987""
Output: 0
Explanation:
Step 1: ""words and 987"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""words and 987"" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: ""words and 987"" (reading stops immediately because there is a non-digit 'w')
         ^
The parsed integer is 0 because no digits were read.

Since 0 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 0.


Example 5:
Input: s = ""-91283472332""
Output: -2147483648
Explanation:
Step 1: ""-91283472332"" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: ""-91283472332"" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
          ^
Step 3: ""-91283472332"" (""91283472332"" is read in)
                     ^
The parsed integer is -91283472332.

Since -91283472332 is less than the lower bound of the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is clamped to -231 = -2147483648.

38,Count and Say,"The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:
`countAndSay(1) = ""1""`
`countAndSay(n)` is the way you would ""say"" the digit string from `countAndSay(n-1)`, which is then converted into a different digit string.

To determine how you ""say"" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of groups so that each group is a contiguous section all of the same character. Then for each group, say the number of characters, then say the character. To convert the saying into a digit string, replace the counts with a number and concatenate every saying.

For example, the saying and conversion for digit string `""3322251""`:
Given a positive integer `n`, return the `nth` term of the count-and-say sequence.

It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.


Example 1:

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.

For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The canonical path should have the following format:
The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.

Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.

The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.

The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Clarification:
Confused why the returned value is an integer, but your answer is an array?
Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller.

Internally you can think of this:
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.

// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.

87,Scramble String,"We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:
If the length of the string is 1, stop.

If the length of the string is > 1, do the following:
	
Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is `s`, divide it to `x` and `y` where `s = x + y`.

Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, `s` may become `s = x + y` or `s = y + x`.

Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings `x` and `y`.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length, return `true` if `s2` is a scrambled string of `s1`, otherwise, return `false`.


Example 1:
Input: s1 = ""great"", s2 = ""rgeat""
Output: true
Explanation: One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
""great"" --> ""gr/eat"" // divide at random index.

""gr/eat"" --> ""gr/eat"" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.

""gr/eat"" --> ""g/r / e/at"" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at ranom index each of them.

""g/r / e/at"" --> ""r/g / e/at"" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.

""r/g / e/at"" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t"" // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide ""at"" to ""a/t"".

""r/g / e/ a/t"" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t"" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.

The algorithm stops now and the result string is ""rgeat"" which is s2.

Adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with `val = 1`. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `ith` station to its next `(i + 1)th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique

Example 1:
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.

Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.


Example 2:
Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.

Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.

Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

138,Copy List with Random Pointer,"A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:
`val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
`random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

Your code will only be given the `head` of the original linked list.

154,Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II,"Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7]` might become:
`[4,5,6,7,0,1,4]` if it was rotated `4` times.

`[0,1,4,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that rotating an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

157,Read N Characters Given Read4,"Given a `file` and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method to read `n` characters.

Method read4: 
The API `read4` reads four consecutive characters from `file`, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf4`.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.

Definition of read4:
    Parameter:  char[] buf4
    Returns:    int
buf4[] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4[].

Below is a high-level example of how `read4` works:
File file(""abcde`""); // File is ""`abcde`"", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 = ""abcd"", fp points to 'e'
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 = ""e"", fp points to end of file
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 = """", fp points to end of file`
Method read:
By using the `read4` method, implement the method read that reads `n` characters from `file` and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you cannot manipulate `file` directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Definition of read: 
    Parameters:	char[] buf, int n

Note:
Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for `read4` but not for `read`.

The `read` function will only be called once for each test case.

You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.


Example 1:
Input: file = ""abc"", n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain ""abc"". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.

Note that ""abc"" is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.


Example 2:
Input: file = ""abcde"", n = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain ""abcde"". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.


Example 3:
Input: file = ""abcdABCD1234"", n = 12

You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing `n` characters.

It is guaranteed that in a given test case the same buffer `buf` is called by `read`.


Example 1:

sol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain ""bc"". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.

sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.

Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.

160,Intersection of Two Linked Lists,"Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:
It is guaranteed that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.


Example 1:
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).

From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.


Example 2:
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).

From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.


Example 3:
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.

Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.


Constraints:
The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.

The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.

165,Compare Version Numbers,"Given two version numbers, `version1` and `version2`, compare them.

Version numbers consist of one or more revisions joined by a dot `'.'`. Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Every revision contains at least one character. Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example `2.5.33` and `0.1` are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using their integer value ignoring any leading zeros. This means that revisions `1` and `001` are considered equal. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then treat the revision as `0`. For example, version `1.0` is less than version `1.1` because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are `0` and `1` respectively, and `0 < 1`.

Return the following:
If `version1 < version2`, return `-1`.

If `version1 > version2`, return `1`.

Otherwise, return `0`.


Example 1:
Input: version1 = ""1.01"", version2 = ""1.001""

Input: version1 = ""1.0"", version2 = ""1.0.0""
Output: 0
Explanation: version1 does not specify revision 2, which means it is treated as ""0"".


Example 3:
Input: version1 = ""0.1"", version2 = ""1.1""
Output: -1
Explanation: version1's revision 0 is ""0"", while version2's revision 0 is ""1"". 0 < 1, so version1 < version2.

`BSTIterator(TreeNode root)` Initializes an object of the `BSTIterator` class. The `root` of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.

`boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns `false`.

`int next()` Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer.

Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to `next()` will return the smallest element in the BST.

Our valiant knight was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through `dungeon` to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to `0` or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).

To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.

Return the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess.

Note that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

218,The Skyline Problem,"A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:
`lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.

`righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.

`heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.

The skyline should be represented as a list of ""key points"" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]`

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.

Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.

Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.

Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

296,Best Meeting Point,"Given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where each `1` marks the home of one friend, return the minimal total travel distance.

The total travel distance is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.

The distance is calculated using Manhattan Distance, where `distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|`.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]

Explanation: Given three friends living at (0,0), (0,4), and (2,2).

The point (0,2) is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 is minimal.

So return 6.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

The number of ""bulls"", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.

The number of ""cows"", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return the hint for your friend's guess.

The hint should be formatted as `""xAyB""`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.

332,Reconstruct Itinerary,"You are given a list of airline `tickets` where `tickets[i] = [fromi, toi]` represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.

All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `""JFK""`, thus, the itinerary must begin with `""JFK""`. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.

For example, the itinerary `[""JFK"", ""LGA""]` has a smaller lexical order than `[""JFK"", ""LGB""]`.

You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.


Example 1:
Input: tickets = [[""MUC"",""LHR""],[""JFK"",""MUC""],[""SFO"",""SJC""],[""LHR"",""SFO""]]

The 2nd pattern `[4,1,9,2]` is invalid because the line connecting dots `1` and `9` pass through dot `5`, but dot `5` did not previously appear in the sequence.

The 3rd pattern `[2,4,1,3,6]` is valid because it follows the conditions. The line connecting dots `1` and `3` meets the condition because dot `2` previously appeared in the sequence.

The 4th pattern `[6,5,4,1,9,2]` is valid because it follows the conditions. The line connecting dots `1` and `9` meets the condition because dot `5` previously appeared in the sequence.

Given two integers `m` and `n`, return the number of unique and valid unlock patterns of the Android grid lock screen that consist of at least `m` keys and at most `n` keys.

Two unlock patterns are considered unique if there is a dot in one sequence that is not in the other, or the order of the dots is different.

353,Design Snake Game,"Design a Snake game that is played on a device with screen size `height x width`. Play the game online if you are not familiar with the game.

The snake is initially positioned at the top left corner `(0, 0)` with a length of `1` unit.

You are given an array `food` where `food[i] = (ri, ci)` is the row and column position of a piece of food that the snake can eat. When a snake eats a piece of food, its length and the game's score both increase by `1`.

Each piece of food appears one by one on the screen, meaning the second piece of food will not appear until the snake eats the first piece of food.

When a piece of food appears on the screen, it is guaranteed that it will not appear on a block occupied by the snake.

The game is over if the snake goes out of bounds (hits a wall) or if its head occupies a space that its body occupies after moving (i.e. a snake of length 4 cannot run into itself).

Implement the `SnakeGame` class:
`SnakeGame(int width, int height, int[][] food)` Initializes the object with a screen of size `height x width` and the positions of the `food`.

`int move(String direction)` Returns the score of the game after applying one `direction` move by the snake. If the game is over, return `-1`.

I pick a number between `1` and `n`.

You guess a number.

If you guess the right number, you win the game.

If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower, and you will continue guessing.

Given a particular `n`, return the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick.

Explanation: The winning strategy is as follows:
- The range is [1,10]. Guess 7.

    - If my number is higher, the range is [8,10]. Guess 9.

        - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $9.

        - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.

        - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.

    - If my number is lower, the range is [1,6]. Guess 3.

        - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $3.

        - If my number is higher, the range is [4,6]. Guess 5.

            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $5.

            - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.

            - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.

        - If my number is lower, the range is [1,2]. Guess 1.

            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.

            - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.

The worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay $16. Hence, you only need $16 to guarantee a win.

376,Wiggle Subsequence,"A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with two or fewer elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example, `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a wiggle sequence because the differences `(6, -3, 5, -7, 3)` alternate between positive and negative.

In contrast, `[1, 4, 7, 2, 5]` and `[1, 7, 4, 5, 5]` are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.

A subsequence is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of `nums`.

388,Longest Absolute File Path,"Suppose we have a file system that stores both files and directories. An example of one system is represented in the following picture:
Here, we have `dir` as the only directory in the root. `dir` contains two subdirectories, `subdir1` and `subdir2`. `subdir1` contains a file `file1.ext` and subdirectory `subsubdir1`. `subdir2` contains a subdirectory `subsubdir2`, which contains a file `file2.ext`.

In text form, it looks like this (with ⟶ representing the tab character):
dir
⟶ subdir1
⟶ ⟶ file1.ext
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir1
⟶ subdir2
⟶ ⟶ subsubdir2
⟶ ⟶ ⟶ file2.ext
If we were to write this representation in code, it will look like this: `""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext""`. Note that the `'\n'` and `'\t'` are the new-line and tab characters.

Every file and directory has a unique absolute path in the file system, which is the order of directories that must be opened to reach the file/directory itself, all concatenated by `'/'s`. Using the above example, the absolute path to `file2.ext` is `""dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext""`. Each directory name consists of letters, digits, and/or spaces. Each file name is of the form `name.extension`, where `name` and `extension` consist of letters, digits, and/or spaces.

Given a string `input` representing the file system in the explained format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return `0`.


Example 1:
Input: input = ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext""
Output: 20
Explanation: We have only one file, and the absolute path is ""dir/subdir2/file.ext"" of length 20.


Example 2:
Input: input = ""dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext""
Output: 32
Explanation: We have two files:
""dir/subdir1/file1.ext"" of length 21
""dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"" of length 32.

We return 32 since it is the longest absolute path to a file.


Example 3:
Input: input = ""a""
Output: 0
Explanation: We do not have any files, just a single directory named ""a"".


Example 4:
Input: input = ""file1.txt\nfile2.txt\nlongfile.txt""
Output: 12
Explanation: There are 3 files at the root directory.

Since the absolute path for anything at the root directory is just the name itself, the answer is ""longfile.txt"" with length 12.

393,UTF-8 Validation,"Given an integer array `data` representing the data, return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:
For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a `0`, followed by its Unicode code.

For an n-bytes character, the first `n` bits are all one's, the `n + 1` bit is `0`, followed by `n - 1` bytes with the most significant `2` bits being `10`.

This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:
`   Char. number range  |        UTF-8 octet sequence
      (hexadecimal)    |              (binary)

   0001 0000-0010 FFFF | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx`
Note: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.


Example 1:
Input: data = [197,130,1]
Output: true
Explanation: data represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.

It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.


Example 2:
Input: data = [235,140,4]
Output: false
Explanation: data represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.

The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.

The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.

Explanation:
F(0) = (0 * 4) + (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (3 * 6) = 0 + 3 + 4 + 18 = 25
F(1) = (0 * 6) + (1 * 4) + (2 * 3) + (3 * 2) = 0 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
F(2) = (0 * 2) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 4) + (3 * 3) = 0 + 6 + 8 + 9 = 23
F(3) = (0 * 3) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 4) = 0 + 2 + 12 + 12 = 26

406,Queue Reconstruction by Height,"You are given an array of people, `people`, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each `people[i] = [hi, ki]` represents the `ith` person of height `hi` with exactly `ki` other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to `hi`.

Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array `people`. The returned queue should be formatted as an array `queue`, where `queue[j] = [hj, kj]` is the attributes of the `jth` person in the queue (`queue[0]` is the person at the front of the queue).


Example 1:
Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.

Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.

Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.

Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.

Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.

Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.

Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.

411,Minimum Unique Word Abbreviation,"A string can be abbreviated by replacing any number of non-adjacent substrings with their lengths. For example, a string such as `""substitution""` could be abbreviated as (but not limited to):
`""s10n""` (`""s ubstitutio n""`)
`""sub4u4""` (`""sub stit u tion""`)
`""12""` (`""substitution""`)
`""su3i1u2on""` (`""su bst i t u ti on""`)
`""substitution""` (no substrings replaced)
Note that `""s55n""` (`""s ubsti tutio n""`) is not a valid abbreviation of `""substitution""` because the replaced substrings are adjacent.

The length of an abbreviation is the number of letters that were not replaced plus the number of substrings that were replaced. For example, the abbreviation `""s10n""` has a length of `3` (`2` letters + `1` substring) and `""su3i1u2on""` has a length of `9` (`6` letters + `3` substrings).

Given a target string `target` and an array of strings `dictionary`, return an abbreviation of `target` with the shortest possible length such that it is not an abbreviation of any string in `dictionary`. If there are multiple shortest abbreviations, return any of them.


Example 1:
Input: target = ""apple"", dictionary = [""blade""]
Output: ""a4""
Explanation: The shortest abbreviation of ""apple"" is ""5"", but this is also an abbreviation of ""blade"".

The next shortest abbreviations are ""a4"" and ""4e"". ""4e"" is an abbreviation of blade while ""a4"" is not.

Hence, return ""a4"".


Example 2:
Input: target = ""apple"", dictionary = [""blade"",""plain"",""amber""]
Output: ""1p3""
Explanation: ""5"" is an abbreviation of both ""apple"" but also every word in the dictionary.

""a4"" is an abbreviation of ""apple"" but also ""amber"".

""4e"" is an abbreviation of ""apple"" but also ""blade"".

""1p3"", ""2p2"", and ""3l1"" are the next shortest abbreviations of ""apple"".

Since none of them are abbreviations of words in the dictionary, returning any of them is correct.

426,Convert Binary Search Tree to Sorted Doubly Linked List,"Convert a Binary Search Tree to a sorted Circular Doubly-Linked List in place.

You can think of the left and right pointers as synonymous to the predecessor and successor pointers in a doubly-linked list. For a circular doubly linked list, the predecessor of the first element is the last element, and the successor of the last element is the first element.

We want to do the transformation in place. After the transformation, the left pointer of the tree node should point to its predecessor, and the right pointer should point to its successor. You should return the pointer to the smallest element of the linked list.


Example 1:
Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: The figure below shows the transformed BST. The solid line indicates the successor relationship, while the dashed line means the predecessor relationship.


Example 2:
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3]

Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: []
Explanation: Input is an empty tree. Output is also an empty Linked List.

Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

427,Construct Quad Tree,"Given a `n * n` matrix `grid` of `0's` and `1's` only. We want to represent the `grid` with a Quad-Tree.

Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing the `grid`.

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when `isLeaf` is False, and both are accepted in the answer.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:
`val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. 
`isLeaf`: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.

class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:
If the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1's` or all `0's`) set `isLeaf` True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.

If the current grid has different values, set `isLeaf` to False and set `val` to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.

Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.

If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.

Quad-Tree format:
The output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list `[isLeaf, val]`.

If the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is True we represent it as 1 in the list `[isLeaf, val]` and if the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is False we represent it as 0.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:
Notice that 0 represnts False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
Explanation: All values in the grid are not the same. We divide the grid into four sub-grids.

The topLeft, bottomLeft and bottomRight each has the same value.

The topRight have different values so we divide it into 4 sub-grids where each has the same value.

Explanation is shown in the photo below:

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: [[1,1]]

Example 4:
Input: grid = [[0]]
Output: [[1,0]]

428,Serialize and Deserialize N-ary Tree,"Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize an N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

For example, you may serialize the following `3-ary` tree
as `[1 [3[5 6] 2 4]]`. Note that this is just an example, you do not necessarily need to follow this format.

Or you can follow LeetCode's level order traversal serialization format, where each group of children is separated by the null value.

For example, the above tree may be serialized as `[1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]`.

You do not necessarily need to follow the above suggested formats, there are many more different formats that work so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

430,Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List,"You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.


Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
Explanation:
The multilevel linked list in the input is as follows:
After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2,null,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation:
The input multilevel linked list is as follows:
  1---2---NULL
  |
  3---NULL

Example 3:
Input: head = []
Output: []
How multilevel linked list is represented in test case:

We use the multilevel linked list from Example 1 above:
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL
The serialization of each level is as follows:
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]
To serialize all levels together we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[null,null,7,8,9,10,null]
[null,11,12,null]
Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]

443,String Compression,"Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:
Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in `chars`:
If the group's length is 1, append the character to `s`.

Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string `s` should not be returned separately, but instead be stored in the input character array `chars`. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.

Could you solve it using only `O(1)` extra space?

Example 1:
Input: chars = [""a"",""a"",""b"",""b"",""c"",""c"",""c""]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: [""a"",""2"",""b"",""2"",""c"",""3""]
Explanation: The groups are ""aa"", ""bb"", and ""ccc"". This compresses to ""a2b2c3"".


Example 2:
Input: chars = [""a""]
Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: [""a""]
Explanation: The only group is ""a"", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.


Example 3:
Input: chars = [""a"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b""]
Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: [""a"",""b"",""1"",""2""].
Explanation: The groups are ""a"" and ""bbbbbbbbbbbb"". This compresses to ""ab12"".

If `nums[i]` is negative, move `nums[i]` steps backward.

Since the array is circular, you may assume that moving forward from the last element puts you on the first element, and moving backwards from the first element puts you on the last element.

`void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if present, or inserts the `key` if not already present. When the cache reaches its `capacity`, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used `key` would be invalidated.

To determine the least frequently used key, a use counter is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest use counter is the least frequently used key.

When a key is first inserted into the cache, its use counter is set to `1` (due to the `put` operation). The use counter for a key in the cache is incremented either a `get` or `put` operation is called on it.

464,Can I Win,"In the ""100 game"" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from `1` to `10`. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.

What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?
For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.

Given two integers maxChoosableInteger and desiredTotal, return `true` if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise return `false`. Assume both players play optimally.


Example 1:
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11

Explanation:
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.

The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.

If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.

The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.

Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.

480,Sliding Window Median,"Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.


Examples:
`[2,3,4]` , the median is `3`
`[2,3]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`
Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Your job is to output the median array for each window in the original array.

For example,
Given nums = `[1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7]`, and k = 3.

Window position                Median
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       1
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       -1
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       -1

 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       5
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      6
Therefore, return the median sliding window as `[1,-1,-1,3,5,6]`.

481,Magical String,"A magical string S consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:
The string S is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string S itself.

The first few elements of string S is the following:
S = ""1221121221221121122......""
If we group the consecutive '1's and '2's in S, it will be:
1   22  11  2  1  22  1  22  11  2  11  22 ......

Each time a player picks a number, that number will not be available for the next player. This continues until all the scores have been chosen. The player with the maximum score wins.

Given an array of scores, predict whether player 1 is the winner. You can assume each player plays to maximize his score.


Example 1:
Input: [1, 5, 2]
Output: False
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return False.

499,The Maze III,"There is a ball in a `maze` with empty spaces (represented as `0`) and walls (represented as `1`). The ball can go through the empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction. There is also a hole in this maze. The ball will drop into the hole if it rolls onto the hole.

Given the `m x n` `maze`, the ball's position `ball` and the hole's position `hole`, where `ball = [ballrow, ballcol]` and `hole = [holerow, holecol]`, return a string `instructions` of all the instructions that the ball should follow to drop in the hole with the shortest distance possible. If there are multiple valid instructions, return the lexicographically minimum one. If the ball can't drop in the hole, return `""impossible""`.

If there is a way for the ball to drop in the hole, the answer `instructions` should contain the characters `'u'` (i.e., up), `'d'` (i.e., down), `'l'` (i.e., left), and `'r'` (i.e., right).

The distance is the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the destination (included).

You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls (see examples).


Example 1:
Input: maze = [[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1],[0,1,0,0,0]], ball = [4,3], hole = [0,1]
Output: ""lul""
Explanation: There are two shortest ways for the ball to drop into the hole.

The first way is left -> up -> left, represented by ""lul"".

The second way is up -> left, represented by 'ul'.

Both ways have shortest distance 6, but the first way is lexicographically smaller because 'l' < 'u'. So the output is ""lul"".

Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects. 
You are given several projects. For each project i, it has a pure profit Pi and a minimum capital of Ci is needed to start the corresponding project. Initially, you have W capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.

To sum up, pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and output your final maximized capital.


Example 1:
Input: k=2, W=0, Profits=[1,2,3], Capital=[0,1,1].
Output: 4
Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.

             After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.

             With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.

             Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.

             Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.

Given a string ring, which represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string key, which represents the keyword needs to be spelled. You need to find the minimum number of steps in order to spell all the characters in the keyword.

Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at 12:00 direction. You need to spell all the characters in the string key one by one by rotating the ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at 12:00 direction and then by pressing the center button.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:
You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise one place, which counts as 1 step. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of the string ring's characters at the 12:00 direction, where this character must equal to the character key[i].

If the character key[i] has been aligned at the 12:00 direction, you need to press the center button to spell, which also counts as 1 step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage), otherwise, you've finished all the spelling.


Example:
Input: ring = ""godding"", key = ""gd""
Output: 4
Explanation:
For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. 
For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring ""godding"" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become ""ddinggo"".

Also, we need 1 more step for spelling.

Other subsequences of `""aebdc""` include `""aebdc""`, `""aeb""`, and `""""` (empty string).

An uncommon subsequence between two strings is a string that is a subsequence of one but not the other.

Return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between `a` and `b`. If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return `-1`.

We need to call the function `pickIndex()` which randomly returns an integer in the range `[0, w.length - 1]`. `pickIndex()` should return the integer proportional to its weight in the `w` array. For example, for `w = [1, 3]`, the probability of picking the index `0` is `1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25` (i.e 25%) while the probability of picking the index `1` is `3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75` (i.e 75%).

More formally, the probability of picking index `i` is `w[i] / sum(w)`.


Example 1:
Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex""]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]
Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. Since there is only one single element on the array the only option is to return the first element.

Input
[""Solution"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex"",""pickIndex""]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]
Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It's returning the second element (index = 1) that has probability of 3/4.

solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It's returning the first element (index = 0) that has probability of 1/4.

Now, you're given n teams, you need to output their final contest matches in the form of a string.

The n teams are given in the form of positive integers from 1 to n, which represents their initial rank. (Rank 1 is the strongest team and Rank n is the weakest team.) We'll use parentheses('(', ')') and commas(',') to represent the contest team pairing - parentheses('(' , ')') for pairing and commas(',') for partition. During the pairing process in each round, you always need to follow the strategy of making the rather strong one pair with the rather weak one.


Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: (1,2)
Explanation: 
Initially, we have the team 1 and the team 2, placed like: 1,2.

Then we pair the team (1,2) together with '(', ')' and ',', which is the final answer.


Example 2:
Input: 4
Output: ((1,4),(2,3))
Explanation: 
In the first round, we pair the team 1 and 4, the team 2 and 3 together, as we need to make the strong team and weak team together.

And we got (1,4),(2,3).

In the second round, the winners of (1,4) and (2,3) need to play again to generate the final winner, so you need to add the paratheses outside them.

545,Boundary of Binary Tree,"The boundary of a binary tree is the concatenation of the root, the left boundary, the leaves ordered from left-to-right, and the reverse order of the right boundary.

The left boundary is the set of nodes defined by the following:
The root node's left child is in the left boundary. If the root does not have a left child, then the left boundary is empty.

If a node in the left boundary and has a left child, then the left child is in the left boundary.

If a node is in the left boundary, has no left child, but has a right child, then the right child is in the left boundary.

The leftmost leaf is not in the left boundary.

The right boundary is similar to the left boundary, except it is the right side of the root's right subtree. Again, the leaf is not part of the right boundary, and the right boundary is empty if the root does not have a right child.

The leaves are nodes that do not have any children. For this problem, the root is not a leaf.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the values of its boundary.


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,4,2]
Explanation:
- The left boundary is empty because the root does not have a left child.

- The right boundary follows the path starting from the root's right child 2 -> 4.

  4 is a leaf, so the right boundary is [2].

- The leaves from left to right are [3,4].

Concatenating everything results in [1] + [] + [3,4] + [2] = [1,3,4,2].


Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10]
Output: [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3]
Explanation:
- The left boundary follows the path starting from the root's left child 2 -> 4.

  4 is a leaf, so the left boundary is [2].

- The right boundary follows the path starting from the root's right child 3 -> 6 -> 10.

  10 is a leaf, so the right boundary is [3,6], and in reverse order is [6,3].

- The leaves from left to right are [4,7,8,9,10].

Concatenating everything results in [1] + [2] + [4,7,8,9,10] + [6,3] = [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3].

558,Logical OR of Two Binary Grids Represented as Quad-Trees,"A Binary Matrix is a matrix in which all the elements are either 0 or 1.

Given `quadTree1` and `quadTree2`. `quadTree1` represents a `n * n` binary matrix and `quadTree2` represents another `n * n` binary matrix. 
Return a Quad-Tree representing the `n * n` binary matrix which is the result of logical bitwise OR of the two binary matrixes represented by `quadTree1` and `quadTree2`.

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when `isLeaf` is False, and both are accepted in the answer.

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:
`val`: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. 
`isLeaf`: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.

class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:
If the current grid has the same value (i.e all `1's` or all `0's`) set `isLeaf` True and set `val` to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.

If the current grid has different values, set `isLeaf` to False and set `val` to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.

Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.

If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.

Quad-Tree format:
The input/output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where `null` signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

It is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list `[isLeaf, val]`.

If the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is True we represent it as 1 in the list `[isLeaf, val]` and if the value of `isLeaf` or `val` is False we represent it as 0.


Example 1:
Input: quadTree1 = [[0,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,0]]
, quadTree2 = [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: [[0,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: quadTree1 and quadTree2 are shown above. You can see the binary matrix which is represented by each Quad-Tree.

If we apply logical bitwise OR on the two binary matrices we get the binary matrix below which is represented by the result Quad-Tree.

Notice that the binary matrices shown are only for illustration, you don't have to construct the binary matrix to get the result tree.


Example 2:
Input: quadTree1 = [[1,0]]
, quadTree2 = [[1,0]]
Output: [[1,0]]
Explanation: Each tree represents a binary matrix of size 1*1. Each matrix contains only zero.

The resulting matrix is of size 1*1 with also zero.


Example 3:
Input: quadTree1 = [[0,0],[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
, quadTree2 = [[0,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0],[1,1]]
Output: [[1,1]]

Example 4:
Input: quadTree1 = [[0,0],[1,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]
, quadTree2 = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,1],null,null,null,null,[1,1],[1,0],[1,0],[1,1]]
Output: [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,1],null,null,null,null,[1,1],[1,0],[1,0],[1,1]]

Example 5:
Input: quadTree1 = [[0,1],[1,0],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]

Explanation: All possible pairings (ignoring the ordering of elements) are:

2. (1, 3), (2, 4) -> min(1, 3) + min(2, 4) = 1 + 2 = 3

563,Binary Tree Tilt,"Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the sum of every tree node's tilt.

The tilt of a tree node is the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and all right subtree node values. If a node does not have a left child, then the sum of the left subtree node values is treated as `0`. The rule is similar if there the node does not have a right child.


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Tilt of node 2 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 2; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 3)
Sum of every tilt : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1

Example 2:
Input: root = [4,2,9,3,5,null,7]

Explanation: 
Tilt of node 3 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 5 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 7 : |0-0| = 0 (no children)
Tilt of node 2 : |3-5| = 2 (left subtree is just left child, so sum is 3; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 5)
Tilt of node 9 : |0-7| = 7 (no left child, so sum is 0; right subtree is just right child, so sum is 7)
Tilt of node 4 : |(3+5+2)-(9+7)| = |10-16| = 6 (left subtree values are 3, 5, and 2, which sums to 10; right subtree values are 9 and 7, which sums to 16)

568,Maximum Vacation Days,"LeetCode wants to give one of its best employees the option to travel among N cities to collect algorithm problems. But all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, you could take vacations in some particular cities and weeks. Your job is to schedule the traveling to maximize the number of vacation days you could take, but there are certain rules and restrictions you need to follow.

Rules and restrictions:
You can only travel among N cities, represented by indexes from 0 to N-1. Initially, you are in the city indexed 0 on Monday.

The cities are connected by flights. The flights are represented as a N*N matrix (not necessary symmetrical), called flights representing the airline status from the city i to the city j. If there is no flight from the city i to the city j, flights[i][j] = 0; Otherwise, flights[i][j] = 1. Also, flights[i][i] = 0 for all i.

You totally have K weeks (each week has 7 days) to travel. You can only take flights at most once per day and can only take flights on each week's Monday morning. Since flight time is so short, we don't consider the impact of flight time.

For each city, you can only have restricted vacation days in different weeks, given an N*K matrix called days representing this relationship. For the value of days[i][j], it represents the maximum days you could take vacation in the city i in the week j.

You're given the flights matrix and days matrix, and you need to output the maximum vacation days you could take during K weeks.


Example 1:
Input:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[1,3,1],[6,0,3],[3,3,3]]
Output: 12
Explanation: Ans = 6 + 3 + 3 = 12. 
One of the best strategies is:
1st week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 6 days and work 1 day. (Although you start at city 0, we could also fly to and start at other cities since it is Monday.) 
2nd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 3 days and work 4 days.

3rd week : stay at city 2, and play 3 days and work 4 days.


Example 2:
Input:flights = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], days = [[1,1,1],[7,7,7],[7,7,7]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Ans = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. 
Since there is no flights enable you to move to another city, you have to stay at city 0 for the whole 3 weeks. For each week, you only have one day to play and six days to work. So the maximum number of vacation days is 3.


Example 3:
Input:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[7,0,0],[0,7,0],[0,0,7]]
Output: 21
Explanation:Ans = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21
One of the best strategies is:
1st week : stay at city 0, and play 7 days. 
2nd week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 7 days.

3rd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 7 days.

Note:
N and K are positive integers, which are in the range of [1, 100].

In the matrix flights, all the values are integers in the range of [0, 1].

In the matrix days, all the values are integers in the range [0, 7].

You could stay at a city beyond the number of vacation days, but you should work on the extra days, which won't be counted as vacation days.

If you fly from the city A to the city B and take the vacation on that day, the deduction towards vacation days will count towards the vacation days of city B in that week.

591,Tag Validator,"Given a string representing a code snippet, you need to implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid. A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:
The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.

A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : `<TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>`. Among them, `<TAG_NAME>` is the start tag, and `</TAG_NAME>` is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.

A valid `TAG_NAME` only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the `TAG_NAME` is invalid.

A valid `TAG_CONTENT` may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched `<`, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the `TAG_CONTENT` is invalid.

A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.

A `<` is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent `>`. And when you find a `<` or `</`, all the subsequent characters until the next `>` should be parsed as TAG_NAME  (not necessarily valid).

The cdata has the following format : `<![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>`. The range of `CDATA_CONTENT` is defined as the characters between `<![CDATA[` and the first subsequent `]]>`. 
`CDATA_CONTENT` may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse `CDATA_CONTENT`, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters. 

Valid Code Examples:
Input: ""<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>""
Output: True
Explanation: 
The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. 
The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. 
Although CDATA_CONTENT has unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as tag.

So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.

Input: ""<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>""
Output: True
Explanation:
We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.

start_tag -> ""<DIV>""
end_tag -> ""</DIV>""
tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.

text1 -> "">>  ![cdata[]] ""
cdata -> ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>"", where the CDATA_CONTENT is ""<div>]>""
text2 -> ""]]>>]""
The reason why start_tag is NOT ""<DIV>>>"" is because of the rule 6.

The reason why cdata is NOT ""<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>"" is because of the rule 7.


Invalid Code Examples:
Input: ""<A>  <B> </A>   </B>""
Output: False
Explanation: Unbalanced. If ""<A>"" is closed, then ""<B>"" must be unmatched, and vice versa.

Input: ""<DIV>  div tag is not closed  <DIV>""
Output: False
Input: ""<DIV>  unmatched <  </DIV>""
Output: False
Input: ""<DIV> closed tags with invalid tag name  <b>123</b> </DIV>""
Output: False
Input: ""<DIV> unmatched tags with invalid tag name  </1234567890> and <CDATA[[]]>  </DIV>""
Output: False
Input: ""<DIV>  unmatched start tag <B>  and unmatched end tag </C>  </DIV>""

A group of duplicate files consists of at least two files that have the same content.

A single directory info string in the input list has the following format:
`""root/d1/d2/.../dm f1.txt(f1_content) f2.txt(f2_content) ... fn.txt(fn_content)""`
It means there are `n` files `(f1.txt, f2.txt ... fn.txt)` with content `(f1_content, f2_content ... fn_content)` respectively in the directory ""`root/d1/d2/.../dm""`. Note that `n >= 1` and `m >= 0`. If `m = 0`, it means the directory is just the root directory.

The output is a list of groups of duplicate file paths. For each group, it contains all the file paths of the files that have the same content. A file path is a string that has the following format:
`""directory_path/file_name.txt""`

The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle.

One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.

Implementation the `MyCircularQueue` class:
`MyCircularQueue(k)` Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be `k`.

`int Front()` Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return `-1`.

`int Rear()` Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return `-1`.

`int Get(int row, char column):` Return the value at `C(row, column)`.

`int Sum(int row, char column, List of Strings : numbers):` This function calculate and set the value at `C(row, column)`, where the value should be the sum of cells represented by `numbers`. This function return the sum result at `C(row, column)`. This sum formula should exist until this cell is overlapped by another value or another sum formula.

`numbers` is a list of strings that each string represent a cell or a range of cells. If the string represent a single cell, then it has the following format : `ColRow`. For example, ""F7"" represents the cell at (7, F). 
If the string represent a range of cells, then it has the following format : `ColRow1:ColRow2`. The range will always be a rectangle, and ColRow1 represent the position of the top-left cell, and ColRow2 represents the position of the bottom-right cell. 

Example 1:
Excel(3,""C""); 
// construct a 3*3 2D array with all zero.

//   A B C
// 1 0 0 0
// 2 0 0 0
// 3 0 0 0
Set(1, ""A"", 2);
// set C(1,""A"") to be 2.

//   A B C
// 1 2 0 0
// 2 0 0 0
// 3 0 0 0
Sum(3, ""C"", [""A1"", ""A1:B2""]);
// set C(3,""C"") to be the sum of value at C(1,""A"") and the values sum of the rectangle range whose top-left cell is C(1,""A"") and bottom-right cell is C(2,""B""). Return 4. 
//   A B C
// 1 2 0 0
// 2 0 0 0
// 3 0 0 4
Set(2, ""B"", 2);
// set C(2,""B"") to be 2. Note C(3, ""C"") should also be changed.

//   A B C
// 1 2 0 0
// 2 0 2 0
// 3 0 0 6
Note:
You could assume that there won't be any circular sum reference. For example, A1 = sum(B1) and B1 = sum(A1).

`int[] retrieve(string start, string end, string granularity)` Returns the IDs of the logs whose timestamps are within the range from `start` to `end` inclusive. `start` and `end` all have the same format as `timestamp`, and `granularity` means how precise the range should be (i.e. to the exact `Day`, `Minute`, etc.). For example, `start = ""2017:01:01:23:59:59""`, `end = ""2017:01:02:23:59:59""`, and `granularity = ""Day""` means that we need to find the logs within the inclusive range from Jan. 1st 2017 to Jan. 2nd 2017, and the `Hour`, `Minute`, and `Second` for each log entry can be ignored.

636,Exclusive Time of Functions,"On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing `n` functions. Each function has a unique ID between `0` and `n-1`.

Function calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.

You are given a list `logs`, where `logs[i]` represents the `ith` log message formatted as a string `""{function_id}:{""start"" | ""end""}:{timestamp}""`. For example, `""0:start:3""` means a function call with function ID `0` started at the beginning of timestamp `3`, and `""1:end:2""` means a function call with function ID `1` ended at the end of timestamp `2`. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.

A function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for `2` time units and another call executing for `1` time unit, the exclusive time is `2 + 1 = 3`.

Return the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the `ith` index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID `i`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""1:start:2"",""1:end:5"",""0:end:6""]
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.

Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.

Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.

So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.


Example 2:
Input: n = 1, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""0:start:6"",""0:end:6"",""0:end:7""]
Output: [8]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.

Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.

Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.

Function 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.

Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.

So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.


Example 3:
Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""1:start:6"",""1:end:6"",""0:end:7""]
Output: [7,1]
Explanation:
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.

Function 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.

Function 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.

Function 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 units of time, and ends at the end of time 6.

Function 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.

So function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.


Example 4:
Input: n = 2, logs = [""0:start:0"",""0:start:2"",""0:end:5"",""1:start:7"",""1:end:7"",""0:end:8""]

639,Decode Ways II,"A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:
'A' -> ""1""
'B' -> ""2""
...

'Z' -> ""26""
To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `""11106""` can be mapped into:
`""AAJF""` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`
`""KJF""` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`
Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `""06""` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `""6""` is different from `""06""`.

In addition to the mapping above, an encoded message may contain the `'*'` character, which can represent any digit from `'1'` to `'9'` (`'0'` is excluded). For example, the encoded message `""1*""` may represent any of the encoded messages `""11""`, `""12""`, `""13""`, `""14""`, `""15""`, `""16""`, `""17""`, `""18""`, or `""19""`. Decoding `""1*""` is equivalent to decoding any of the encoded messages it can represent.

Given a string `s` containing digits and the `'*'` character, return the number of ways to decode it.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""*""
Output: 9
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5"", ""6"", ""7"", ""8"", or ""9"".

Each of these can be decoded to the strings ""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"", ""E"", ""F"", ""G"", ""H"", and ""I"" respectively.

Hence, there are a total of 9 ways to decode ""*"".


Example 2:
Input: s = ""1*""
Output: 18
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""11"", ""12"", ""13"", ""14"", ""15"", ""16"", ""17"", ""18"", or ""19"".

Each of these encoded messages have 2 ways to be decoded (e.g. ""11"" can be decoded to ""AA"" or ""K"").

Hence, there are a total of 9 * 2 = 18 ways to decode ""1*"".


Example 3:
Input: s = ""2*""
Output: 15
Explanation: The encoded message can represent any of the encoded messages ""21"", ""22"", ""23"", ""24"", ""25"", ""26"", ""27"", ""28"", or ""29"".

""21"", ""22"", ""23"", ""24"", ""25"", and ""26"" have 2 ways of being decoded, but ""27"", ""28"", and ""29"" only have 1 way.

Hence, there are a total of (6 * 2) + (3 * 1) = 12 + 3 = 15 ways to decode ""2*"".

642,Design Search Autocomplete System,"Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input a sentence (at least one word and end with a special character `'#'`). For each character they type except '#', you need to return the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed. Here are the specific rules:
The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same sentence before.

The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the hottest one). If several sentences have the same degree of hot, you need to use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).

If less than 3 hot sentences exist, then just return as many as you can.

When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need to return an empty list.

Your job is to implement the following functions:
The constructor function:
`AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times):` This is the constructor. The input is historical data. `Sentences` is a string array consists of previously typed sentences. `Times` is the corresponding times a sentence has been typed. Your system should record these historical data.

Now, the user wants to input a new sentence. The following function will provide the next character the user types:
`List<String> input(char c):` The input `c` is the next character typed by the user. The character will only be lower-case letters (`'a'` to `'z'`), blank space (`' '`) or a special character (`'#'`). Also, the previously typed sentence should be recorded in your system. The output will be the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed.


Example:
Operation: AutocompleteSystem([""i love you"", ""island"",""ironman"", ""i love leetcode""], [5,3,2,2])
The system have already tracked down the following sentences and their corresponding times:
`""i love you""` : `5` times
`""island""` : `3` times
`""ironman""` : `2` times
`""i love leetcode""` : `2` times
Now, the user begins another search:
Operation: input('i')
Output: [""i love you"", ""island"",""i love leetcode""]
Explanation:
There are four sentences that have prefix `""i""`. Among them, ""ironman"" and ""i love leetcode"" have same hot degree. Since `' '` has ASCII code 32 and `'r'` has ASCII code 114, ""i love leetcode"" should be in front of ""ironman"". Also we only need to output top 3 hot sentences, so ""ironman"" will be ignored.

Operation: input(' ')
Output: [""i love you"",""i love leetcode""]
Explanation:
There are only two sentences that have prefix `""i ""`.

Operation: input('a')
Output: []
Explanation:
There are no sentences that have prefix `""i a""`.

Operation: input('#')
Output: []
Explanation:
The user finished the input, the sentence `""i a""` should be saved as a historical sentence in system. And the following input will be counted as a new search.

Note:
The input sentence will always start with a letter and end with '#', and only one blank space will exist between two words.

The number of complete sentences that to be searched won't exceed 100. The length of each sentence including those in the historical data won't exceed 100.

649,Dota2 Senate,"In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the `Radiant` and the `Dire`.

The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the senate wants to make a decision about a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can exercise `one` of the two rights:
`Ban one senator's right`:
	A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.

`Announce the victory`:
	If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory and make the decision about the change in the game.

Given a string representing each senator's party belonging. The character 'R' and 'D' represent the `Radiant` party and the `Dire` party respectively. Then if there are `n` senators, the size of the given string will be `n`.

The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.

Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party, you need to predict which party will finally announce the victory and make the change in the Dota2 game. The output should be `Radiant` or `Dire`.

You may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, `""01:34""`, `""12:09""` are all valid. `""1:34""`, `""12:9""` are all invalid.


Example 1:
Input: time = ""19:34""
Output: ""19:39""
Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 1, 9, 3, 4, is 19:39, which occurs 5 minutes later.

It is not 19:33, because this occurs 23 hours and 59 minutes later.

682,Baseball Game,"You are keeping score for a baseball game with strange rules. The game consists of several rounds, where the scores of past rounds may affect future rounds' scores.

At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record. You are given a list of strings `ops`, where `ops[i]` is the `ith` operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:
An integer `x` - Record a new score of `x`.

`""+""` - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores. It is guaranteed there will always be two previous scores.

`""D""` - Record a new score that is double the previous score. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score.

`""C""` - Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score.

Return the sum of all the scores on the record.


Example 1:
Input: ops = [""5"",""2"",""C"",""D"",""+""]

Explanation:
""5"" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].

""-2"" - Add -2 to the record, record is now [5, -2].

""4"" - Add 4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, 4].

""C"" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5, -2].

""D"" - Add 2 * -2 = -4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4].

""9"" - Add 9 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9].

""+"" - Add -4 + 9 = 5 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5].

""+"" - Add 9 + 5 = 14 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14].

699,Falling Squares,"On an infinite number line (x-axis), we drop given squares in the order they are given.

The `i`-th square dropped (`positions[i] = (left, side_length)`) is a square with the left-most point being `positions[i][0]` and sidelength `positions[i][1]`.

The square is dropped with the bottom edge parallel to the number line, and from a higher height than all currently landed squares. We wait for each square to stick before dropping the next.

The squares are infinitely sticky on their bottom edge, and will remain fixed to any positive length surface they touch (either the number line or another square). Squares dropped adjacent to each other will not stick together prematurely.

Return a list `ans` of heights. Each height `ans[i]` represents the current highest height of any square we have dropped, after dropping squares represented by `positions[0], positions[1], ..., positions[i]`.


Example 1:
Input: [[1, 2], [2, 3], [6, 1]]
Output: [2, 5, 5]
Explanation:
After the first drop of `positions[0] = [1, 2]: _aa _aa ------- `The maximum height of any square is 2.

After the second drop of `positions[1] = [2, 3]: __aaa __aaa __aaa _aa__ _aa__ -------------- `The maximum height of any square is 5. The larger square stays on top of the smaller square despite where its center of gravity is, because squares are infinitely sticky on their bottom edge.

After the third drop of `positions[1] = [6, 1]: __aaa __aaa __aaa _aa _aa___a -------------- `The maximum height of any square is still 5. Thus, we return an answer of `[2, 5, 5]`.

A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: `val` and `next`. `val` is the value of the current node, and `next` is a pointer/reference to the next node.

If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute `prev` to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.

Implement the `MyLinkedList` class:
`MyLinkedList()` Initializes the `MyLinkedList` object.

`int get(int index)` Get the value of the `indexth` node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return `-1`.

`void addAtHead(int val)` Add a node of value `val` before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.

`void addAtTail(int val)` Append a node of value `val` as the last element of the linked list.

`void addAtIndex(int index, int val)` Add a node of value `val` before the `indexth` node in the linked list. If `index` equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If `index` is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.

`void deleteAtIndex(int index)` Delete the `indexth` node in the linked list, if the index is valid.

If there are multiple suitable places for insertion, you may choose any place to insert the new value. After the insertion, the circular list should remain sorted.

If the list is empty (i.e., given node is `null`), you should create a new single circular list and return the reference to that single node. Otherwise, you should return the original given node.

Explanation: Deleting ""s"" from ""sea"" adds the ASCII value of ""s"" (115) to the sum.

Deleting ""t"" from ""eat"" adds 116 to the sum.

At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.

715,Range Module,"A Range Module is a module that tracks ranges of numbers. Your task is to design and implement the following interfaces in an efficient manner.

`addRange(int left, int right)` Adds the half-open interval `[left, right)`, tracking every real number in that interval.  Adding an interval that partially overlaps with currently tracked numbers should add any numbers in the interval `[left, right)` that are not already tracked.

`queryRange(int left, int right)` Returns true if and only if every real number in the interval `[left, right)`
 is currently being tracked.

`removeRange(int left, int right)` Stops tracking every real number currently being tracked in the interval `[left, right)`.


Example 1:
addRange(10, 20): null
removeRange(14, 16): null
queryRange(10, 14): true (Every number in [10, 14) is being tracked)
queryRange(13, 15): false (Numbers like 14, 14.03, 14.17 in [13, 15) are not being tracked)
queryRange(16, 17): true (The number 16 in [16, 17) is still being tracked, despite the remove operation)
Note:
A half open interval `[left, right)` denotes all real numbers `left <= x < right`.

`0 < left < right < 10^9` in all calls to `addRange, queryRange, removeRange`.

`MaxStack()` Initializes the stack object.

`void push(int x)` Pushes element `x` onto the stack.

`int pop()` Removes the element on top of the stack and returns it.

`int top()` Gets the element on the top of the stack without removing it.

`int peekMax()` Retrieves the maximum element in the stack without removing it.

`int popMax()` Retrieves the maximum element in the stack and removes it. If there is more than one maximum element, only remove the top-most one.

MaxStack stk = new MaxStack();
stk.push(5);   // [5] the top of the stack and the maximum number is 5.

stk.push(1);   // [5, 1] the top of the stack is 1, but the maximum is 5.

stk.push(5);   // [5, 1, 5] the top of the stack is 5, which is also the maximum, because it is the top most one.

stk.top();     // return 5, [5, 1, 5] the stack did not change.

stk.popMax();  // return 5, [5, 1] the stack is changed now, and the top is different from the max.

stk.top();     // return 1, [5, 1] the stack did not change.

stk.peekMax(); // return 5, [5, 1] the stack did not change.

Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.

After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.

Explanation:
The first and third John's are the same person as they have the common email ""johnsmith@mail.com"".

The second John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses are used by other accounts.

We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'mary@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] would still be accepted.

722,Remove Comments,"Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program `source` is an array where `source[i]` is the `i`-th line of the source code.  This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character `\n`.

In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.

The string `//` denotes a line comment, which represents that it and rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.

The string `/*` denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of `*/` should be ignored.  (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.)  To be clear, the string `/*/` does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.

The first effective comment takes precedence over others: if the string `//` occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. Similarly, if the string `/*` occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.

If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.

There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.  For example, `source = ""string s = ""/* Not a comment. */"";""` will not be a test case.  (Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.)
It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so `/*` outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.

Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments.  Please see the examples below for details.

After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.


Example 1:
Input: 
source = [""/*Test program */"", ""int main()"", ""{ "", ""  // variable declaration "", ""int a, b, c;"", ""/* This is a test"", ""   multiline  "", ""   comment for "", ""   testing */"", ""a = b + c;"", ""}""]
The line by line code is visualized as below:
/*Test program */
int main()
{ 
  // variable declaration 
int a, b, c;
/* This is a test
   multiline  
   comment for 
   testing */
a = b + c;
}
Output: [""int main()"",""{ "",""  "",""int a, b, c;"",""a = b + c;"",""}""]
The line by line code is visualized as below:
int main()
{ 
  
int a, b, c;
a = b + c;
}
Explanation: 
The string `/*` denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string `//` denotes line 4 as comments.


Example 2:
Input: 
source = [""a/*comment"", ""line"", ""more_comment*/b""]
Output: [""ab""]
Explanation: The original source string is ""a/*comment\nline\nmore_comment*/b"", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string ""ab"", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [""ab""].

Note:
The length of `source` is in the range `[1, 100]`.

723,Candy Crush,"This question is about implementing a basic elimination algorithm for Candy Crush.

Given a 2D integer array `board` representing the grid of candy, different positive integers `board[i][j]` represent different types of candies. A value of `board[i][j] = 0` represents that the cell at position `(i, j)` is empty. The given board represents the state of the game following the player's move. Now, you need to restore the board to a stable state by crushing candies according to the following rules:
If three or more candies of the same type are adjacent vertically or horizontally, ""crush"" them all at the same time - these positions become empty.

After crushing all candies simultaneously, if an empty space on the board has candies on top of itself, then these candies will drop until they hit a candy or bottom at the same time. (No new candies will drop outside the top boundary.)
After the above steps, there may exist more candies that can be crushed. If so, you need to repeat the above steps.

If there does not exist more candies that can be crushed (ie. the board is stable), then return the current board.

You need to perform the above rules until the board becomes stable, then return the current board.

The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.

If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is `0` because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.

Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.

The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than 1.  This may lead to some parts being null.

The parts should be in order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal parts occurring later.

A subsequence of a string S is obtained by deleting 0 or more characters from S.

A sequence is palindromic if it is equal to the sequence reversed.

Two sequences `A_1, A_2, ...` and `B_1, B_2, ...` are different if there is some `i` for which `A_i != B_i`.

Two sentences are similar if:
They have the same length (i.e. the same number of words)
`sentence1[i]` and `sentence2[i]` are similar.

Notice that a word is always similar to itself, also notice that the similarity relation is not transitive. For example, if the words `a` and `b` are similar and the words `b` and `c` are similar, `a` and `c` are not necessarily similar.

736,Parse Lisp Expression,"You are given a string `expression` representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.

The syntax for these expressions is given as follows.

An expression is either an integer, a let-expression, an add-expression, a mult-expression, or an assigned variable.  Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.

(An integer could be positive or negative.)
A let-expression takes the form `(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)`, where `let` is always the string `""let""`, then there are 1 or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable `v1` is assigned the value of the expression `e1`, the second variable `v2` is assigned the value of the expression `e2`, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let-expression is the value of the expression `expr`.

An add-expression takes the form `(add e1 e2)` where `add` is always the string `""add""`, there are always two expressions `e1, e2`, and this expression evaluates to the addition of the evaluation of `e1` and the evaluation of `e2`.

A mult-expression takes the form `(mult e1 e2)` where `mult` is always the string `""mult""`, there are always two expressions `e1, e2`, and this expression evaluates to the multiplication of the evaluation of `e1` and the evaluation of `e2`.

For the purposes of this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names.  A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits.  Additionally for your convenience, the names ""add"", ""let"", or ""mult"" are protected and will never be used as variable names.

Finally, there is the concept of scope.  When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially.  It is guaranteed that every expression is legal.  Please see the examples for more details on scope.


Evaluation Examples:
Input: (add 1 2)
Output: 3
Input: (mult 3 (add 2 3))
Output: 15
Input: (let x 2 (mult x 5))
Output: 10
Input: (let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))
Output: 14
Explanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,
we check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.

Since x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.

Input: (let x 3 x 2 x)
Output: 2
Explanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.

Input: (let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))
Output: 5
Explanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.

The second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.

Input: (let x 2 (add (let x 3 (let x 4 x)) x))
Output: 6
Explanation: Even though (let x 4 x) has a deeper scope, it is outside the context
of the final x in the add-expression.  That final x will equal 2.

Input: (let a1 3 b2 (add a1 1) b2) 
Output 4
Explanation: Variable names can contain digits after the first character.

Note:
The given string `expression` is well formatted: There are no leading or trailing spaces, there is only a single space separating different components of the string, and no space between adjacent parentheses.  The expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer.

Note that the similarity relation is transitive. For example, if ""great"" and ""good"" are similar, and ""fine"" and ""good"" are similar, then ""great"" and ""fine"" are similar.

Similarity is also symmetric. For example, ""great"" and ""fine"" being similar is the same as ""fine"" and ""great"" being similar.

Also, a word is always similar with itself. For example, the sentences `words1 = [""great""], words2 = [""great""], pairs = []` are similar, even though there are no specified similar word pairs.

Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of words. So a sentence like `words1 = [""great""]` can never be similar to `words2 = [""doubleplus"",""good""]`.

The length of `words1` and `words2` will not exceed `1000`.

748,Shortest Completing Word,"Given a string `licensePlate` and an array of strings `words`, find the shortest completing word in `words`.

A completing word is a word that contains all the letters in `licensePlate`. Ignore numbers and spaces in `licensePlate`, and treat letters as case insensitive. If a letter appears more than once in `licensePlate`, then it must appear in the word the same number of times or more.

For example, if `licensePlate`` = ""aBc 12c""`, then it contains letters `'a'`, `'b'` (ignoring case), and `'c'` twice. Possible completing words are `""abccdef""`, `""caaacab""`, and `""cbca""`.

Return the shortest completing word in `words`. It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there are multiple shortest completing words, return the first one that occurs in `words`.


Example 1:
Input: licensePlate = ""1s3 PSt"", words = [""step"",""steps"",""stripe"",""stepple""]
Output: ""steps""
Explanation: licensePlate contains letters 's', 'p', 's' (ignoring case), and 't'.

""step"" contains 't' and 'p', but only contains 1 's'.

""steps"" contains 't', 'p', and both 's' characters.

""stripe"" is missing an 's'.

""stepple"" is missing an 's'.

Since ""steps"" is the only word containing all the letters, that is the answer.


Example 2:
Input: licensePlate = ""1s3 456"", words = [""looks"",""pest"",""stew"",""show""]
Output: ""pest""
Explanation: licensePlate only contains the letter 's'. All the words contain 's', but among these ""pest"", ""stew"", and ""show"" are shortest. The answer is ""pest"" because it is the word that appears earliest of the 3.

749,Contain Virus,"A virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected area by installing walls.

The world is modeled as a 2-D array of cells, where `0` represents uninfected cells, and `1` represents cells contaminated with the virus.  A wall (and only one wall) can be installed between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells, on the shared boundary.

Every night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless blocked by a wall.

Resources are limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region -- the affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that threatens the most uninfected cells the following night. There will never be a tie.

Can you save the day? If so, what is the number of walls required? If not, and the world becomes fully infected, return the number of walls used.

751,IP to CIDR,"Given a start IP address `ip` and a number of ips we need to cover `n`, return a representation of the range as a list (of smallest possible length) of CIDR blocks.

A CIDR block is a string consisting of an IP, followed by a slash, and then the prefix length.  For example: ""123.45.67.89/20"".  That prefix length ""20"" represents the number of common prefix bits in the specified range.


Example 1:
Input: ip = ""255.0.0.7"", n = 10
Output: [""255.0.0.7/32"",""255.0.0.8/29"",""255.0.0.16/32""]
Explanation:
The initial ip address, when converted to binary, looks like this (spaces added for clarity):
255.0.0.7 -> 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000111
The address ""255.0.0.7/32"" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 32 bits to the given address,
ie. just this one address.

The address ""255.0.0.8/29"" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 29 bits to the given address:
255.0.0.8 -> 11111111 00000000 00000000 00001000
Addresses with common prefix of 29 bits are:
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001000
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001001
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001010
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001011
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001100
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001101
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001110
11111111 00000000 00000000 00001111
The address ""255.0.0.16/32"" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 32 bits to the given address,
ie. just 11111111 00000000 00000000 00010000.

In total, the answer specifies the range of 10 ips starting with the address 255.0.0.7 .

There were other representations, such as:
[""255.0.0.7/32"",""255.0.0.8/30"", ""255.0.0.12/30"", ""255.0.0.16/32""],
but our answer was the shortest possible.

Also note that a representation beginning with say, ""255.0.0.7/30"" would be incorrect,
because it includes addresses like 255.0.0.4 = 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000100

752,Open the Lock,"You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: `'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'`. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn `'9'` to be `'0'`, or `'0'` to be `'9'`. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.

The lock initially starts at `'0000'`, a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.

You are given a list of `deadends` dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.

Given a `target` representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.

Input: deadends = [""0201"",""0101"",""0102"",""1212"",""2002""], target = ""0202""

Explanation:
A sequence of valid moves would be ""0000"" -> ""1000"" -> ""1100"" -> ""1200"" -> ""1201"" -> ""1202"" -> ""0202"".

Note that a sequence like ""0000"" -> ""0001"" -> ""0002"" -> ""0102"" -> ""0202"" would be invalid,
because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the dead end ""0102"".

755,Pour Water,"We are given an elevation map, `heights[i]` representing the height of the terrain at that index.  The width at each index is 1.  After `V` units of water fall at index `K`, how much water is at each index?
Water first drops at index `K` and rests on top of the highest terrain or water at that index.  Then, it flows according to the following rules:
If the droplet would eventually fall by moving left, then move left.

Otherwise, if the droplet would eventually fall by moving right, then move right.

Otherwise, rise at it's current position.

Here, ""eventually fall"" means that the droplet will eventually be at a lower level if it moves in that direction.

Also, ""level"" means the height of the terrain plus any water in that column.

We can assume there's infinitely high terrain on the two sides out of bounds of the array.  Also, there could not be partial water being spread out evenly on more than 1 grid block - each unit of water has to be in exactly one block.


Example 1:
Input: heights = [2,1,1,2,1,2,2], V = 4, K = 3

 0123456    
When moving left or right, the water can only move to the same level or a lower level.

(By level, we mean the total height of the terrain plus any water in that column.)
Since moving left will eventually make it fall, it moves left.

(A droplet ""made to fall"" means go to a lower height than it was at previously.)

Since moving left will not make it fall, it stays in place.  The next droplet falls:
#       #

 0123456  
Since the new droplet moving left will eventually make it fall, it moves left.

Notice that the droplet still preferred to move left,

757,Set Intersection Size At Least Two,"An integer interval `[a, b]` (for integers `a < b`) is a set of all consecutive integers from `a` to `b`, including `a` and `b`.

Find the minimum size of a set S such that for every integer interval A in `intervals`, the intersection of S with A has a size of at least two.


Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[3,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Consider the set S = {2, 3, 4}.  For each interval, there are at least 2 elements from S in the interval.

Also, there isn't a smaller size set that fulfills the above condition.

Thus, we output the size of this set, which is 3.

For example, given that `words = [""ab"", ""bc""]` and `S = ""aabcd""`, we should return `""a<b>abc</b>d""`. Note that returning `""a<b>a<b>b</b>c</b>d""` would use more tags, so it is incorrect.

An expression alternates chunks and symbols, with a space separating each chunk and symbol.

A chunk is either an expression in parentheses, a variable, or a non-negative integer.

A variable is a string of lowercase letters (not including digits.) Note that variables can be multiple letters, and note that variables never have a leading coefficient or unary operator like `""2x""` or `""-x""`.

Expressions are evaluated in the usual order: brackets first, then multiplication, then addition and subtraction. For example, `expression = ""1 + 2 * 3""` has an answer of `[""7""]`.

The format of the output is as follows:
For each term of free variables with non-zero coefficient, we write the free variables within a term in sorted order lexicographically. For example, we would never write a term like `""b*a*c""`, only `""a*b*c""`.

Terms have degree equal to the number of free variables being multiplied, counting multiplicity. (For example, `""a*a*b*c""` has degree 4.) We write the largest degree terms of our answer first, breaking ties by lexicographic order ignoring the leading coefficient of the term.

The leading coefficient of the term is placed directly to the left with an asterisk separating it from the variables (if they exist.)  A leading coefficient of 1 is still printed.

An example of a well formatted answer is `[""-2*a*a*a"", ""3*a*a*b"", ""3*b*b"", ""4*a"", ""5*c"", ""-6""]` 
Terms (including constant terms) with coefficient 0 are not included.  For example, an expression of ""0"" has an output of [].

Now rain starts to fall. At time `t`, the depth of the water everywhere is `t`. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distance in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

The `board` is a 3 x 3 array, and consists of characters `"" ""`, `""X""`, and `""O""`.  The "" "" character represents an empty square.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:
Players take turns placing characters into empty squares ("" "").

The first player always places ""X"" characters, while the second player always places ""O"" characters.

""X"" and ""O"" characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones.

The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.

The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.

For example, if we have `[2, 4, 1, 3, 0]`, and we rotate by `K = 2`, it becomes `[1, 3, 0, 2, 4]`.  This is worth 3 points because 1 > 0 [no points], 3 > 1 [no points], 0 <= 2 [one point], 2 <= 3 [one point], 4 <= 4 [one point].

Over all possible rotations, return the rotation index K that corresponds to the highest score we could receive.  If there are multiple answers, return the smallest such index K.


Example 1:
Input: [2, 3, 1, 4, 0]
Output: 3
Explanation:  
Scores for each K are listed below: 
K = 0,  A = [2,3,1,4,0],    score 2
K = 1,  A = [3,1,4,0,2],    score 3

799,Champagne Tower,"We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has `1` glass, the second row has `2` glasses, and so on until the 100th row.  Each glass holds one cup of champagne.

Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top.  When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it.  When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.)
For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.  After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.  After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.  After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.

Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the `jth` glass in the `ith` row is (both `i` and `j` are 0-indexed.)

Example 1:
Input: poured = 1, query_row = 1, query_glass = 1
Output: 0.00000
Explanation: We poured 1 cup of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There will be no excess liquid so all the glasses under the top glass will remain empty.

Input: poured = 2, query_row = 1, query_glass = 1
Output: 0.50000
Explanation: We poured 2 cups of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There is one cup of excess liquid. The glass indexed as (1, 0) and the glass indexed as (1, 1) will share the excess liquid equally, and each will get half cup of champange.

803,Bricks Falling When Hit,"You are given an `m x n` binary `grid`, where each `1` represents a brick and `0` represents an empty space. A brick is stable if:
It is directly connected to the top of the grid, or
At least one other brick in its four adjacent cells is stable.

You are also given an array `hits`, which is a sequence of erasures we want to apply. Each time we want to erase the brick at the location `hits[i] = (rowi, coli)`. The brick on that location (if it exists) will disappear. Some other bricks may no longer be stable because of that erasure and will fall. Once a brick falls, it is immediately erased from the `grid` (i.e., it does not land on other stable bricks).

Return an array `result`, where each `result[i]` is the number of bricks that will fall after the `ith` erasure is applied.

Note that an erasure may refer to a location with no brick, and if it does, no bricks drop.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,1,0]], hits = [[1,0]]
Output: [2]
Explanation: Starting with the grid:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,0]]
We erase the underlined brick at (1,0), resulting in the grid:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [0,1,1,0]]
The two underlined bricks are no longer stable as they are no longer connected to the top nor adjacent to another stable brick, so they will fall. The resulting grid is:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0]]
Hence the result is [2].


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0]], hits = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [0,0]
Explanation: Starting with the grid:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]
We erase the underlined brick at (1,1), resulting in the grid:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0]]
All remaining bricks are still stable, so no bricks fall. The grid remains the same:
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0]]
Next, we erase the underlined brick at (1,0), resulting in the grid:
[[1,0,0,0],

Serve 25 ml of soup A and 75 ml of soup B
When we serve some soup, we give it to someone and we no longer have it.  Each turn, we will choose from the four operations with equal probability 0.25. If the remaining volume of soup is not enough to complete the operation, we will serve as much as we can.  We stop once we no longer have some quantity of both types of soup.

Note that we do not have the operation where all 100 ml's of soup B are used first.  
Return the probability that soup A will be empty first, plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time.


Example:
Input: N = 50
Output: 0.625
Explanation: 
If we choose the first two operations, A will become empty first. For the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time. For the fourth operation, B will become empty first. So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.

809,Expressive Words,"Sometimes people repeat letters to represent extra feeling, such as ""hello"" -> ""heeellooo"", ""hi"" -> ""hiiii"".  In these strings like ""heeellooo"", we have groups of adjacent letters that are all the same:  ""h"", ""eee"", ""ll"", ""ooo"".

For some given string `S`, a query word is stretchy if it can be made to be equal to `S` by any number of applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters `c`, and add some number of characters `c` to the group so that the size of the group is 3 or more.

For example, starting with ""hello"", we could do an extension on the group ""o"" to get ""hellooo"", but we cannot get ""helloo"" since the group ""oo"" has size less than 3.  Also, we could do another extension like ""ll"" -> ""lllll"" to get ""helllllooo"".  If `S = ""helllllooo""`, then the query word ""hello"" would be stretchy because of these two extension operations: `query = ""hello"" -> ""hellooo"" -> ""helllllooo"" = S`.

Given a list of query words, return the number of words that are stretchy. 

Example:
Input: 
S = ""heeellooo""
words = [""hello"", ""hi"", ""helo""]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We can extend ""e"" and ""o"" in the word ""hello"" to get ""heeellooo"".

We can't extend ""helo"" to get ""heeellooo"" because the group ""ll"" is not size 3 or more.

810,Chalkboard XOR Game,"We are given non-negative integers nums[i] which are written on a chalkboard.  Alice and Bob take turns erasing exactly one number from the chalkboard, with Alice starting first.  If erasing a number causes the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard to become 0, then that player loses.  (Also, we'll say the bitwise XOR of one element is that element itself, and the bitwise XOR of no elements is 0.)
Also, if any player starts their turn with the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard equal to 0, then that player wins.

Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.


Example:
Input: nums = [1, 1, 2]
Output: false
Explanation: 
Alice has two choices: erase 1 or erase 2. 
If she erases 1, the nums array becomes [1, 2]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 2 = 3. Now Bob can remove any element he wants, because Alice will be the one to erase the last element and she will lose. 
If Alice erases 2 first, now nums becomes [1, 1]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 1 = 0. Alice will lose.

811,Subdomain Visit Count,"A website domain like ""discuss.leetcode.com"" consists of various subdomains. At the top level, we have ""com"", at the next level, we have ""leetcode.com"", and at the lowest level, ""discuss.leetcode.com"". When we visit a domain like ""discuss.leetcode.com"", we will also visit the parent domains ""leetcode.com"" and ""com"" implicitly.

Now, call a ""count-paired domain"" to be a count (representing the number of visits this domain received), followed by a space, followed by the address. An example of a count-paired domain might be ""9001 discuss.leetcode.com"".

We are given a list `cpdomains` of count-paired domains. We would like a list of count-paired domains, (in the same format as the input, and in any order), that explicitly counts the number of visits to each subdomain.


Example 1:
Input: 
[""9001 discuss.leetcode.com""]
Output: 
[""9001 discuss.leetcode.com"", ""9001 leetcode.com"", ""9001 com""]
Explanation: 
We only have one website domain: ""discuss.leetcode.com"". As discussed above, the subdomain ""leetcode.com"" and ""com"" will also be visited. So they will all be visited 9001 times.


Example 2:
Input: 
[""900 google.mail.com"", ""50 yahoo.com"", ""1 intel.mail.com"", ""5 wiki.org""]
Output: 
[""901 mail.com"",""50 yahoo.com"",""900 google.mail.com"",""5 wiki.org"",""5 org"",""1 intel.mail.com"",""951 com""]
Explanation: 
We will visit ""google.mail.com"" 900 times, ""yahoo.com"" 50 times, ""intel.mail.com"" once and ""wiki.org"" 5 times. For the subdomains, we will visit ""mail.com"" 900 + 1 = 901 times, ""com"" 900 + 50 + 1 = 951 times, and ""org"" 5 times.

Example:
Input:

Explanation: The character 'e' appears at indices 3, 5, 6, and 11 (0-indexed).

The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 0 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(0 - 3) = 3.

The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 1 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(1 - 3) = 3.

828,Count Unique Characters of All Substrings of a Given String,"Let's define a function `countUniqueChars(s)` that returns the number of unique characters on `s`, for example if `s = ""LEETCODE""` then `""L""`, `""T""`,`""C""`,`""O""`,`""D""` are the unique characters since they appear only once in `s`, therefore `countUniqueChars(s) = 5`.

On this problem given a string `s` we need to return the sum of `countUniqueChars(t)` where `t` is a substring of `s`. Notice that some substrings can be repeated so on this case you have to count the repeated ones too.

Since the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo `10 ^ 9 + 7`.

831,Masking Personal Information,"We are given a personal information string `S`, which may represent either an email address or a phone number.

We would like to mask this personal information according to the following rules:
1. Email address:
We define a name to be a string of `length ≥ 2` consisting of only lowercase letters `a-z` or uppercase letters `A-Z`.

An email address starts with a name, followed by the symbol `'@'`, followed by a name, followed by the dot `'.'` and followed by a name. 
All email addresses are guaranteed to be valid and in the format of `""name1@name2.name3"".`
To mask an email, all names must be converted to lowercase and all letters between the first and last letter of the first name must be replaced by 5 asterisks `'*'`.

2. Phone number:
A phone number is a string consisting of only the digits `0-9` or the characters from the set `{'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '}.` You may assume a phone number contains 10 to 13 digits.

The last 10 digits make up the local number, while the digits before those make up the country code. Note that the country code is optional. We want to expose only the last 4 digits and mask all other digits.

The local number should be formatted and masked as `""***-***-1111"", `where `1` represents the exposed digits.

To mask a phone number with country code like `""+111 111 111 1111""`, we write it in the form `""+***-***-***-1111"".`  The `'+'` sign and the first `'-'` sign before the local number should only exist if there is a country code.  For example, a 12 digit phone number mask should start with `""+**-""`.

Note that extraneous characters like `""("", "")"", "" ""`, as well as extra dashes or plus signs not part of the above formatting scheme should be removed.

Return the correct ""mask"" of the information provided.


Example 1:
Input: ""LeetCode@LeetCode.com""
Output: ""l*****e@leetcode.com""
Explanation: All names are converted to lowercase, and the letters between the
             first and last letter of the first name is replaced by 5 asterisks.

             Therefore, ""leetcode"" -> ""l*****e"".


Example 2:
Input: ""AB@qq.com""
Output: ""a*****b@qq.com""
Explanation: There must be 5 asterisks between the first and last letter

Input: ""1(234)567-890""
Output: ""***-***-7890""

832,Flipping an Image,"Given an `n x n` binary matrix `image`, flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.

To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.

For example, flipping `[1,1,0]` horizontally results in `[0,1,1]`.

To invert an image means that each `0` is replaced by `1`, and each `1` is replaced by `0`.

For example, inverting `[0,1,1]` results in `[1,0,0]`.


Example 1:
Input: image = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]

833,Find And Replace in String,"To some string `S`, we will perform some replacement operations that replace groups of letters with new ones (not necessarily the same size).

Each replacement operation has `3` parameters: a starting index `i`, a source word `x` and a target word `y`.  The rule is that if `x` starts at position `i` in the original string `S`, then we will replace that occurrence of `x` with `y`.  If not, we do nothing.

For example, if we have `S = ""abcd""` and we have some replacement operation `i = 2, x = ""cd"", y = ""ffff""`, then because `""cd""` starts at position `2` in the original string `S`, we will replace it with `""ffff""`.

Using another example on `S = ""abcd""`, if we have both the replacement operation `i = 0, x = ""ab"", y = ""eee""`, as well as another replacement operation `i = 2, x = ""ec"", y = ""ffff""`, this second operation does nothing because in the original string `S[2] = 'c'`, which doesn't match `x[0] = 'e'`.

All these operations occur simultaneously.  It's guaranteed that there won't be any overlap in replacement: for example, `S = ""abc"", indexes = [0, 1], sources = [""ab"",""bc""]` is not a valid test case.


Example 1:
Input: S = ""abcd"", indexes = [0, 2], sources = [""a"", ""cd""], targets = [""eee"", ""ffff""]
Output: ""eeebffff""
Explanation:
""a"" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by ""eee"".

""cd"" starts at index 2 in S, so it's replaced by ""ffff"".


Example 2:
Input: S = ""abcd"", indexes = [0, 2], sources = [""ab"",""ec""], targets = [""eee"",""ffff""]
Output: ""eeecd""
Explanation:
""ab"" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by ""eee"".

""ec"" doesn't starts at index 2 in the original S, so we do nothing.

You may call `Master.guess(word)` to guess a word. The guessed word should have type `string` and must be from the original list with `6` lowercase letters.

This function returns an `integer` type, representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the `secret` word. Also, if your guess is not in the given wordlist, it will return `-1` instead.

For each test case, you have exactly `10` guesses to guess the word. At the end of any number of calls, if you have made `10` or fewer calls to `Master.guess` and at least one of these guesses was `secret`, then you pass the test case.


Example 1:
Input: secret = ""acckzz"", wordlist = [""acckzz"",""ccbazz"",""eiowzz"",""abcczz""], numguesses = 10
Output: You guessed the secret word correctly.
Explanation:
master.guess(""aaaaaa"") returns -1, because ""aaaaaa"" is not in wordlist.

master.guess(""acckzz"") returns 6, because ""acckzz"" is secret and has all 6 matches.

master.guess(""ccbazz"") returns 3, because ""ccbazz"" has 3 matches.

master.guess(""eiowzz"") returns 2, because ""eiowzz"" has 2 matches.

master.guess(""abcczz"") returns 4, because ""abcczz"" has 4 matches.

We made 5 calls to master.guess and one of them was the secret, so we pass the test case.


Example 2:
Input: secret = ""hamada"", wordlist = [""hamada"",""khaled""], numguesses = 10
Output: You guessed the secret word correctly.

Constraints:
`1 <= wordlist.length <= 100`
`wordlist[i].length == 6`
`wordlist[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.

There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.

Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized. 
Return that maximum distance to the closest person.


Example 1:
Input: seats = [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the second open seat (i.e. seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.

If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.

Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.


Example 2:
Input: seats = [1,0,0,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the last seat (i.e. seats[3]), the closest person is 3 seats away.

This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.

We'll say that `richer[i] = [x, y]` if person `x` definitely has more money than person `y`.  Note that `richer` may only be a subset of valid observations.

Also, we'll say `quiet[x] = q` if person x has quietness `q`.

Now, return `answer`, where `answer[x] = y` if `y` is the least quiet person (that is, the person `y` with the smallest value of `quiet[y]`), among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than person `x`.


Example 1:
Input: richer = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,7],[4,3],[5,3],[6,3]], quiet = [3,2,5,4,6,1,7,0]
Output: [5,5,2,5,4,5,6,7]
Explanation: 
answer[0] = 5.

Person 5 has more money than 3, which has more money than 1, which has more money than 0.

The only person who is quieter (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7, but
it isn't clear if they have more money than person 0.

Among all people that definitely have equal to or more money than person 7

Each car `i` has a constant speed `speed[i]` (in miles per hour), and initial position `position[i]` miles towards the target along the road.

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it, and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed.

The distance between these two cars is ignored - they are assumed to have the same position.

A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed.  Note that a single car is also a car fleet.

Along the way, there are gas stations.  Each `station[i]` represents a gas station that is `station[i][0]` miles east of the starting position, and has `station[i][1]` liters of gas.

The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has `startFuel` liters of fuel in it.  It uses 1 liter of gas per 1 mile that it drives.

When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.

What is the least number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination?  If it cannot reach the destination, return `-1`.

Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there.  If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.

882,Reachable Nodes In Subdivided Graph,"You are given an undirected graph (the ""original graph"") with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You decide to subdivide each edge in the graph into a chain of nodes, with the number of new nodes varying between each edge.

The graph is given as a 2D array of `edges` where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, cnti]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` in the original graph, and `cnti` is the total number of new nodes that you will subdivide the edge into. Note that `cnti == 0` means you will not subdivide the edge.

To subdivide the edge `[ui, vi]`, replace it with `(cnti + 1)` new edges and `cnti` new nodes. The new nodes are `x1`, `x2`, ..., `xcnti`, and the new edges are `[ui, x1]`, `[x1, x2]`, `[x2, x3]`, ..., `[xcnti+1, xcnti]`, `[xcnti, vi]`.

In this new graph, you want to know how many nodes are reachable from the node `0`, where a node is reachable if the distance is `maxMoves` or less.

Given the original graph and `maxMoves`, return the number of nodes that are reachable from node `0` in the new graph.

900,RLE Iterator,"Write an iterator that iterates through a run-length encoded sequence.

The iterator is initialized by `RLEIterator(int[] A)`, where `A` is a run-length encoding of some sequence.  More specifically, for all even `i`, `A[i]` tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value `A[i+1]` is repeated in the sequence.

The iterator supports one function: `next(int n)`, which exhausts the next `n` elements (`n >= 1`) and returns the last element exhausted in this way.  If there is no element left to exhaust, `next` returns `-1` instead.

For example, we start with `A = [3,8,0,9,2,5]`, which is a run-length encoding of the sequence `[8,8,8,5,5]`.  This is because the sequence can be read as ""three eights, zero nines, two fives"".


Example 1:
Input: [""RLEIterator"",""next"",""next"",""next"",""next""], [[[3,8,0,9,2,5]],[2],[1],[1],[2]]
Output: [null,8,8,5,-1]
Explanation: 
RLEIterator is initialized with RLEIterator([3,8,0,9,2,5]).

This maps to the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].

RLEIterator.next is then called 4 times:
.next(2) exhausts 2 terms of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [8, 5, 5].

.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [5, 5].

.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 5.  The remaining sequence is now [5].

.next(2) exhausts 2 terms, returning -1.  This is because the first term exhausted was 5,
but the second term did not exist.  Since the last term exhausted does not exist, we return -1.

901,Online Stock Span,"Write a class `StockSpanner` which collects daily price quotes for some stock, and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.

The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and going backwards) for which the price of the stock was less than or equal to today's price.

For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were `[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]`, then the stock spans would be `[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]`.


Example 1:
Input: [""StockSpanner"",""next"",""next"",""next"",""next"",""next"",""next"",""next""], [[],[100],[80],[60],[70],[60],[75],[85]]
Output: [null,1,1,1,2,1,4,6]
Explanation: 
First, S = StockSpanner() is initialized.  Then:
S.next(100) is called and returns 1,
S.next(80) is called and returns 1,
S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
S.next(70) is called and returns 2,
S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
S.next(75) is called and returns 4,
S.next(85) is called and returns 6.

Note that (for example) S.next(75) returned 4, because the last 4 prices
(including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.

Note:
Calls to `StockSpanner.next(int price)` will have `1 <= price <= 10^5`.

909,Snakes and Ladders,"On an N x N `board`, the numbers from `1` to `N*N` are written boustrophedonically starting from the bottom left of the board, and alternating direction each row.  For example, for a 6 x 6 board, the numbers are written as follows:
You start on square `1` of the board (which is always in the last row and first column).  Each move, starting from square `x`, consists of the following:
You choose a destination square `S` with number `x+1`, `x+2`, `x+3`, `x+4`, `x+5`, or `x+6`, provided this number is `<= N*N`.

	
(This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: ie., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.)
If `S` has a snake or ladder, you move to the destination of that snake or ladder.  Otherwise, you move to `S`.

A board square on row `r` and column `c` has a ""snake or ladder"" if `board[r][c] != -1`.  The destination of that snake or ladder is `board[r][c]`.

Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move: if the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not continue moving.  (For example, if the board is `[[4,-1],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move your destination square is `2`, then you finish your first move at `3`, because you do not continue moving to `4`.)
Return the least number of moves required to reach square N*N.  If it is not possible, return `-1`.


Example 1:
Input: [

[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
At the beginning, you start at square 1 [at row 5, column 0].

You decide to move to square 2, and must take the ladder to square 15.

You then decide to move to square 17 (row 3, column 5), and must take the snake to square 13.

You then decide to move to square 14, and must take the ladder to square 35.

You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.

936,Stamping The Sequence,"You want to form a `target` string of lowercase letters.

At the beginning, your sequence is `target.length` `'?'` marks.  You also have a `stamp` of lowercase letters.

On each turn, you may place the stamp over the sequence, and replace every letter in the sequence with the corresponding letter from the stamp.  You can make up to `10 * target.length` turns.

For example, if the initial sequence is ""?????"", and your stamp is `""abc""`,  then you may make ""abc??"", ""?abc?"", ""??abc"" in the first turn.  (Note that the stamp must be fully contained in the boundaries of the sequence in order to stamp.)
If the sequence is possible to stamp, then return an array of the index of the left-most letter being stamped at each turn.  If the sequence is not possible to stamp, return an empty array.

For example, if the sequence is ""ababc"", and the stamp is `""abc""`, then we could return the answer `[0, 2]`, corresponding to the moves ""?????"" -> ""abc??"" -> ""ababc"".

Also, if the sequence is possible to stamp, it is guaranteed it is possible to stamp within `10 * target.length` moves.  Any answers specifying more than this number of moves will not be accepted.


Example 1:
Input: stamp = ""abc"", target = ""ababc""
Output: [0,2]

937,Reorder Data in Log Files,"You are given an array of `logs`. Each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is the identifier.

There are two types of logs:
Letter-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.

Digit-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.

Reorder these logs so that:
The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.

The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.

The digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.

Return the final order of the logs.


Example 1:
Input: logs = [""dig1 8 1 5 1"",""let1 art can"",""dig2 3 6"",""let2 own kit dig"",""let3 art zero""]

Example 1:
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]

Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].

2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].

3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].

4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].

5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].

Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.

If your current power is at least `tokens[i]`, you may play the `ith` token face up, losing `tokens[i]` power and gaining `1` score.

If your current score is at least `1`, you may play the `ith` token face down, gaining `tokens[i]` power and losing `1` score.

Explanation: 
We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order doesn't matter), and reorder it.

After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.

We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].

We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].

We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].

We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].

We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].

955,Delete Columns to Make Sorted II,"You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, all of the same length.

We may choose any deletion indices, and we delete all the characters in those indices for each string.

For example, if we have `strs = [""abcdef"",""uvwxyz""]` and deletion indices `{0, 2, 3}`, then the final array after deletions is `[""bef"", ""vyz""]`.

Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices `answer` such that after deletions, the final array has its elements in lexicographic order (i.e., `strs[0] <= strs[1] <= strs[2] <= ... <= strs[n - 1]`). Return the minimum possible value of `answer.length`.


Example 1:
Input: strs = [""ca"",""bb"",""ac""]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
After deleting the first column, strs = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""].

Now strs is in lexicographic order (ie. strs[0] <= strs[1] <= strs[2]).

We require at least 1 deletion since initially strs was not in lexicographic order, so the answer is 1.

For example, with `x = 3`, we might write `3 * 3 / 3 + 3 - 3` which is a value of 3.

When writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions:
The division operator (`/`) returns rational numbers.

There are no parentheses placed anywhere.

We use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.

It is not allowed to use the unary negation operator (`-`). For example, ""`x - x`"" is a valid expression as it only uses subtraction, but ""`-x + x`"" is not because it uses negation.

966,Vowel Spellchecker,"Given a `wordlist`, we want to implement a spellchecker that converts a query word into a correct word.

For a given `query` word, the spell checker handles two categories of spelling mistakes:
Capitalization: If the query matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the case in the wordlist.

	

Example: `wordlist = [""yellow""]`, `query = ""YellOw""`: `correct = ""yellow""`

Example: `wordlist = [""Yellow""]`, `query = ""yellow""`: `correct = ""Yellow""`

Example: `wordlist = [""yellow""]`, `query = ""yellow""`: `correct = ""yellow""`
Vowel Errors: If after replacing the vowels `('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')` of the query word with any vowel individually, it matches a word in the wordlist (case-insensitive), then the query word is returned with the same case as the match in the wordlist.

	

Example: `wordlist = [""YellOw""]`, `query = ""yollow""`: `correct = ""YellOw""`

Example: `wordlist = [""YellOw""]`, `query = ""yeellow""`: `correct = """"` (no match)

Example: `wordlist = [""YellOw""]`, `query = ""yllw""`: `correct = """"` (no match)
In addition, the spell checker operates under the following precedence rules:
When the query exactly matches a word in the wordlist (case-sensitive), you should return the same word back.

When the query matches a word up to capitlization, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.

When the query matches a word up to vowel errors, you should return the first such match in the wordlist.

If the query has no matches in the wordlist, you should return the empty string.

Input: root = [1,2], voyage = [2,1]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: It is impossible to flip the nodes such that the pre-order traversal matches voyage.


Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3], voyage = [1,3,2]
Output: [1]
Explanation: Flipping node 1 swaps nodes 2 and 3, so the pre-order traversal matches voyage.


Example 3:
Input: root = [1,2,3], voyage = [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The tree's pre-order traversal already matches voyage, so no nodes need to be flipped.

972,Equal Rational Numbers,"Given two strings `s` and `t`, each of which represents a non-negative rational number, return `true` if and only if they represent the same number. The strings may use parentheses to denote the repeating part of the rational number.

A rational number can be represented using up to three parts: `<IntegerPart>`, `<NonRepeatingPart>`, and a `<RepeatingPart>`. The number will be represented in one of the following three ways:
`<IntegerPart>`
	
For example, `12`, `0`, and `123`.

`<IntegerPart><.><NonRepeatingPart>`
	
For example, `0.5`, `1.`, `2.12`, and `123.0001`.

`<IntegerPart><.><NonRepeatingPart><(><RepeatingPart><)>`
	
For example, `0.1(6)`, `1.(9)`, `123.00(1212)`.

The repeating portion of a decimal expansion is conventionally denoted within a pair of round brackets. For example:
`1/6 = 0.16666666... = 0.1(6) = 0.1666(6) = 0.166(66)`.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""0.(52)"", t = ""0.5(25)""
Output: true
Explanation: Because ""0.(52)"" represents 0.52525252..., and ""0.5(25)"" represents 0.52525252525..... , the strings represent the same number.


Example 2:
Input: s = ""0.1666(6)"", t = ""0.166(66)""
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: s = ""0.9(9)"", t = ""1.""
Output: true
Explanation: ""0.9(9)"" represents 0.999999999... repeated forever, which equals 1.  [See this link for an explanation.]
""1."" represents the number 1, which is formed correctly: (IntegerPart) = ""1"" and (NonRepeatingPart) = """".


Constraints:
Each part consists only of digits.

973,K Closest Points to Origin,"Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `√(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2`).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).


Example 1:
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).

The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).

Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.

We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].


Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]

975,Odd Even Jump,"You are given an integer array `arr`. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.

You may jump forward from index `i` to index `j` (with `i < j`) in the following way:
During odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index `j` such that `arr[i] <= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices `j`, you can only jump to the smallest such index `j`.

During even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index `j` such that `arr[i] >= arr[j]` and `arr[j]` is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices `j`, you can only jump to the smallest such index `j`.

It may be the case that for some index `i`, there are no legal jumps.

A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index `arr.length - 1`) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).

Return the number of good starting indices.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.

From starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.

From starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.

From starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.

In total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of
jumps.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
From starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:
During our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[0].

During our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2] is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3
During our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3] is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[2].

We can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.

In a similar manner, we can deduce that:
From starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.

From starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.

From starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.

From starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.

In total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some
number of jumps.


Example 3:
Input: arr = [5,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3

986,Interval List Intersections,"You are given two lists of closed intervals, `firstList` and `secondList`, where `firstList[i] = [starti, endi]` and `secondList[j] = [startj, endj]`. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

A closed interval `[a, b]` (with `a < b`) denotes the set of real numbers `x` with `a <= x <= b`.

The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` is `[2, 3]`.


Example 1:
Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]

987,Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree,"Given the `root` of a binary tree, calculate the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.

For each node at position `(row, col)`, its left and right children will be at positions `(row + 1, col - 1)` and `(row + 1, col + 1)` respectively. The root of the tree is at `(0, 0)`.

The vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.

Return the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.


Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
Explanation:
Column -1: Only node 9 is in this column.

Column 0: Nodes 3 and 15 are in this column in that order from top to bottom.

Column 1: Only node 20 is in this column.

Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.


Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation:
Column -2: Only node 4 is in this column.

Column -1: Only node 2 is in this column.

Column 0: Nodes 1, 5, and 6 are in this column.

          1 is at the top, so it comes first.

          5 and 6 are at the same position (2, 0), so we order them by their value, 5 before 6.

Column 1: Only node 3 is in this column.

Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.


Example 3:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,6,5,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation:
This case is the exact same as example 2, but with nodes 5 and 6 swapped.

Note that the solution remains the same since 5 and 6 are in the same location and should be ordered by their values.

1001,Grid Illumination,"You are given a `grid` of size `N x N`, and each cell of this grid has a lamp that is initially turned off.

You are also given an array of lamp positions `lamps`, where `lamps[i] = [rowi, coli]` indicates that the lamp at `grid[rowi][coli]` is turned on. When a lamp is turned on, it illuminates its cell and all other cells in the same row, column, or diagonal.

Finally, you are given a query array `queries`, where `queries[i] = [rowi, coli]`. For the `ith` query, determine whether `grid[rowi][coli]` is illuminated or not. After answering the `ith` query, turn off the lamp at `grid[rowi][coli]` and its 8 adjacent lamps if they exist. A lamp is adjacent if its cell shares either a side or corner with `grid[rowi][coli]`.

Return an array of integers `ans`, where `ans[i]` should be `1` if the lamp in the `ith` query was illuminated, or `0` if the lamp was not.


Example 1:
Input: N = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: We have the initial grid with all lamps turned off. In the above picture we see the grid after turning on the lamp at grid[0][0] then turning on the lamp at grid[4][4].

The 0th query asks if the lamp at grid[1][1] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is illuminated, so set ans[0] = 1. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red square.

The 1st query asks if the lamp at grid[1][0] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is not illuminated, so set ans[1] = 0. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red rectangle.

1006,Clumsy Factorial,"Normally, the factorial of a positive integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.  For example, `factorial(10) = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1`.

We instead make a clumsy factorial: using the integers in decreasing order, we swap out the multiply operations for a fixed rotation of operations: multiply (*), divide (/), add (+) and subtract (-) in this order.

For example, `clumsy(10) = 10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1`.  However, these operations are still applied using the usual order of operations of arithmetic: we do all multiplication and division steps before any addition or subtraction steps, and multiplication and division steps are processed left to right.

Additionally, the division that we use is floor division such that `10 * 9 / 8` equals `11`.  This guarantees the result is an integer.

1040,Moving Stones Until Consecutive II,"On an infinite number line, the position of the i-th stone is given by `stones[i]`.  Call a stone an endpoint stone if it has the smallest or largest position.

Each turn, you pick up an endpoint stone and move it to an unoccupied position so that it is no longer an endpoint stone.

In particular, if the stones are at say, `stones = [1,2,5]`, you cannot move the endpoint stone at position 5, since moving it to any position (such as 0, or 3) will still keep that stone as an endpoint stone.

The game ends when you cannot make any more moves, ie. the stones are in consecutive positions.

When the game ends, what is the minimum and maximum number of moves that you could have made?  Return the answer as an length 2 array: `answer = [minimum_moves, maximum_moves]`

Example 1:
Input: [7,4,9]
Output: [1,2]

Our goal is to assign a bike to each worker. Among the available bikes and workers, we choose the (worker, bike) pair with the shortest Manhattan distance between each other, and assign the bike to that worker. (If there are multiple (worker, bike) pairs with the same shortest Manhattan distance, we choose the pair with the smallest worker index; if there are multiple ways to do that, we choose the pair with the smallest bike index). We repeat this process until there are no available workers.

The Manhattan distance between two points `p1` and `p2` is `Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y - p2.y|`.

1058,Minimize Rounding Error to Meet Target,"Given an array of `prices` `[p1,p2...,pn]` and a `target`, round each price `pi` to `Roundi(pi)` so that the rounded array `[Round1(p1),Round2(p2)...,Roundn(pn)]` sums to the given `target`. Each operation `Roundi(pi)` could be either `Floor(pi)` or `Ceil(pi)`.

Return the string `""-1""` if the rounded array is impossible to sum to `target`. Otherwise, return the smallest rounding error, which is defined as `Σ |Roundi(pi) - (pi)|` for `i` from `1` to `n`, as a string with three places after the decimal.


Example 1:
Input: prices = [""0.700"",""2.800"",""4.900""], target = 8
Output: ""1.000""
Explanation:
Use Floor, Ceil and Ceil operations to get (0.7 - 0) + (3 - 2.8) + (5 - 4.9) = 0.7 + 0.2 + 0.1 = 1.0 .

1059,All Paths from Source Lead to Destination,"Given the `edges` of a directed graph where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi`, and two nodes `source` and `destination` of this graph, determine whether or not all paths starting from `source` eventually, end at `destination`, that is:
At least one path exists from the `source` node to the `destination` node
If a path exists from the `source` node to a node with no outgoing edges, then that node is equal to `destination`.

The number of possible paths from `source` to `destination` is a finite number.

Return `true` if and only if all roads from `source` lead to `destination`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], source = 0, destination = 2
Output: false
Explanation: It is possible to reach and get stuck on both node 1 and node 2.


Example 2:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[2,1]], source = 0, destination = 3
Output: false
Explanation: We have two possibilities: to end at node 3, or to loop over node 1 and node 2 indefinitely.


Example 3:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]], source = 0, destination = 3
Output: true

Example 4:
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,1],[1,2]], source = 0, destination = 2
Output: false
Explanation: All paths from the source node end at the destination node, but there are an infinite number of paths, such as 0-1-2, 0-1-1-2, 0-1-1-1-2, 0-1-1-1-1-2, and so on.

1061,Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String,"Given strings `A` and `B` of the same length, we say A[i] and B[i] are equivalent characters. For example, if `A = ""abc""` and `B = ""cde""`, then we have `'a' == 'c', 'b' == 'd', 'c' == 'e'`.

Equivalent characters follow the usual rules of any equivalence relation:
Reflexivity: 'a' == 'a'
Symmetry: 'a' == 'b' implies 'b' == 'a'
Transitivity: 'a' == 'b' and 'b' == 'c' implies 'a' == 'c'
For example, given the equivalency information from `A` and `B` above, `S = ""eed""`, `""acd""`, and `""aab""` are equivalent strings, and `""aab""` is the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `S`.

Return the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `S` by using the equivalency information from `A` and `B`.


Example 1:
Input: A = ""parker"", B = ""morris"", S = ""parser""
Output: ""makkek""
Explanation: Based on the equivalency information in `A` and `B`, we can group their characters as `[m,p]`, `[a,o]`, `[k,r,s]`, `[e,i]`. The characters in each group are equivalent and sorted in lexicographical order. So the answer is `""makkek""`.


Example 2:
Input: A = ""hello"", B = ""world"", S = ""hold""
Output: ""hdld""
Explanation:  Based on the equivalency information in `A` and `B`, we can group their characters as `[h,w]`, `[d,e,o]`, `[l,r]`. So only the second letter `'o'` in `S` is changed to `'d'`, the answer is `""hdld""`.


Example 3:
Input: A = ""leetcode"", B = ""programs"", S = ""sourcecode""
Output: ""aauaaaaada""
Explanation:  We group the equivalent characters in `A` and `B` as `[a,o,e,r,s,c]`, `[l,p]`, `[g,t]` and `[d,m]`, thus all letters in `S` except `'u'` and `'d'` are transformed to `'a'`, the answer is `""aauaaaaada""`.

Note:
String `A`, `B` and `S` consist of only lowercase English letters from `'a'` - `'z'`.

Explanation: 
The student with ID = 1 got scores 91, 92, 60, 65, 87, and 100. Their top five average is (100 + 92 + 91 + 87 + 65) / 5 = 87.

The student with ID = 2 got scores 93, 97, 77, 100, and 76. Their top five average is (100 + 97 + 93 + 77 + 76) / 5 = 88.6, but with integer division their average converts to 88.

Output: [1.00000,4.00000,2.18182,2.00000,1.00000]
Explanation: The sample represented by count is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4].

The minimum and maximum are 1 and 4 respectively.

The mean is (1+1+1+1+2+2+2+3+3+4+4) / 11 = 24 / 11 = 2.18181818... (for display purposes, the output shows the rounded number 2.18182).

1096,Brace Expansion II,"Under a grammar given below, strings can represent a set of lowercase words.  Let's use `R(expr)` to denote the set of words the expression represents.

Grammar can best be understood through simple examples:
Single letters represent a singleton set containing that word.

	
`R(""a"") = {""a""}`
`R(""w"") = {""w""}`
When we take a comma delimited list of 2 or more expressions, we take the union of possibilities.

	
`R(""{a,b,c}"") = {""a"",""b"",""c""}`
`R(""{{a,b},{b,c}}"") = {""a"",""b"",""c""}` (notice the final set only contains each word at most once)
When we concatenate two expressions, we take the set of possible concatenations between two words where the first word comes from the first expression and the second word comes from the second expression.

	
`R(""{a,b}{c,d}"") = {""ac"",""ad"",""bc"",""bd""}`
`R(""a{b,c}{d,e}f{g,h}"") = {""abdfg"", ""abdfh"", ""abefg"", ""abefh"", ""acdfg"", ""acdfh"", ""acefg"", ""acefh""}`
Formally, the 3 rules for our grammar:
For every lowercase letter `x`, we have `R(x) = {x}`
For expressions `e_1, e_2, ... , e_k` with `k >= 2`, we have `R({e_1,e_2,...}) = R(e_1) ∪ R(e_2) ∪ ...`
For expressions `e_1` and `e_2`, we have `R(e_1 + e_2) = {a + b for (a, b) in R(e_1) × R(e_2)}`, where + denotes concatenation, and × denotes the cartesian product.

Given an `expression` representing a set of words under the given grammar, return the sorted list of words that the expression represents.

1101,The Earliest Moment When Everyone Become Friends,"In a social group, there are `N` people, with unique integer ids from `0` to `N-1`.

We have a list of `logs`, where each `logs[i] = [timestamp, id_A, id_B]` contains a non-negative integer timestamp, and the ids of two different people.

Each log represents the time in which two different people became friends.  Friendship is symmetric: if A is friends with B, then B is friends with A.

Let's say that person A is acquainted with person B if A is friends with B, or A is a friend of someone acquainted with B.

Return the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person. Return -1 if there is no such earliest time.


Example 1:
Input: logs = [[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],[20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2],[20190322,4,5]], N = 6
Output: 20190301
Explanation: 
The first event occurs at timestamp = 20190101 and after 0 and 1 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3], [4], [5].

The second event occurs at timestamp = 20190104 and after 3 and 4 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3,4], [5].

The third event occurs at timestamp = 20190107 and after 2 and 3 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2,3,4], [5].

The fourth event occurs at timestamp = 20190211 and after 1 and 5 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1,5], [2,3,4].

The fifth event occurs at timestamp = 20190224 and as 2 and 4 are already friend anything happens.

The sixth event occurs at timestamp = 20190301 and after 0 and 3 become friends we have that all become friends.

Note:
`2 <= N <= 100`
`1 <= logs.length <= 10^4`

We then give 1 candy to the first person, 2 candies to the second person, and so on until we give `n` candies to the last person.

Then, we go back to the start of the row, giving `n + 1` candies to the first person, `n + 2` candies to the second person, and so on until we give `2 * n` candies to the last person.

This process repeats (with us giving one more candy each time, and moving to the start of the row after we reach the end) until we run out of candies.  The last person will receive all of our remaining candies (not necessarily one more than the previous gift).

We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.

Note again that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we place is the same order as the given sequence of books.  For example, if we have an ordered list of 5 books, we might place the first and second book onto the first shelf, the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the last shelf.

It is the empty string, or
It can be written as `AB` (`A` concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are VPS's, or
It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a VPS.

We can similarly define the nesting depth `depth(S)` of any VPS `S` as follows:
`depth("""") = 0`
`depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B))`, where `A` and `B` are VPS's
`depth(""("" + A + "")"") = 1 + depth(A)`, where `A` is a VPS.

For example,  `""""`, `""()()""`, and `""()(()())""` are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and `"")(""` and `""(()""` are not VPS's.

Given a VPS seq, split it into two disjoint subsequences `A` and `B`, such that `A` and `B` are VPS's (and `A.length + B.length = seq.length`).

Now choose any such `A` and `B` such that `max(depth(A), depth(B))` is the minimum possible value.

Return an `answer` array (of length `seq.length`) that encodes such a choice of `A` and `B`:  `answer[i] = 0` if `seq[i]` is part of `A`, else `answer[i] = 1`.  Note that even though multiple answers may exist, you may return any of them.

1117,Building H2O,"There are two kinds of threads, `oxygen` and `hydrogen`. Your goal is to group these threads to form water molecules. There is a barrier where each thread has to wait until a complete molecule can be formed. Hydrogen and oxygen threads will be given `releaseHydrogen` and `releaseOxygen` methods respectively, which will allow them to pass the barrier. These threads should pass the barrier in groups of three, and they must be able to immediately bond with each other to form a water molecule. You must guarantee that all the threads from one molecule bond before any other threads from the next molecule do.

In other words:
If an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier when no hydrogen threads are present, it has to wait for two hydrogen threads.

If a hydrogen thread arrives at the barrier when no other threads are present, it has to wait for an oxygen thread and another hydrogen thread.

We don’t have to worry about matching the threads up explicitly; that is, the threads do not necessarily know which other threads they are paired up with. The key is just that threads pass the barrier in complete sets; thus, if we examine the sequence of threads that bond and divide them into groups of three, each group should contain one oxygen and two hydrogen threads.

Write synchronization code for oxygen and hydrogen molecules that enforces these constraints.

The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
The depth of the root of the tree is `0`. if the depth of a node is `d`, the depth of each of its children is `d + 1`.

The lowest common ancestor of a set `S` of nodes, is the node `A` with the largest depth such that every node in `S` is in the subtree with root `A`.

Note: This question is the same as 865: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subtree-with-all-the-deepest-nodes/

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
Output: [2,7,4]
Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.

The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest leaf-nodes of the tree.

Note that nodes 6, 0, and 8 are also leaf nodes, but the depth of them is 2, but the depth of nodes 7 and 4 is 3.


Example 2:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree, and it's the lca of itself.


Example 3:
Input: root = [0,1,3,null,2]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The deepest leaf node in the tree is 2, the lca of one node is itself.

1150,Check If a Number Is Majority Element in a Sorted Array,"Given an array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, and a number `target`, return `True` if and only if `target` is a majority element.

A majority element is an element that appears more than `N/2` times in an array of length `N`.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,6], target = 5
Output: true
Explanation: 
The value 5 appears 5 times and the length of the array is 9.

Thus, 5 is a majority element because 5 > 9/2 is true.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [10,100,101,101], target = 101
Output: false
Explanation: 
The value 101 appears 2 times and the length of the array is 4.

Thus, 101 is not a majority element because 2 > 4/2 is false.

1170,Compare Strings by Frequency of the Smallest Character,"Let the function `f(s)` be the frequency of the lexicographically smallest character in a non-empty string `s`. For example, if `s = ""dcce""` then `f(s) = 2` because the lexicographically smallest character is `'c'`, which has a frequency of 2.

You are given an array of strings `words` and another array of query strings `queries`. For each query `queries[i]`, count the number of words in `words` such that `f(queries[i])` < `f(W)` for each `W` in `words`.

Return an integer array `answer`, where each `answer[i]` is the answer to the `ith` query.


Example 1:
Input: queries = [""cbd""], words = [""zaaaz""]
Output: [1]
Explanation: On the first query we have f(""cbd"") = 1, f(""zaaaz"") = 3 so f(""cbd"") < f(""zaaaz"").

Given an integer `k`, for every consecutive sequence of `k` days (`calories[i], calories[i+1], ..., calories[i+k-1]` for all `0 <= i <= n-k`), they look at T, the total calories consumed during that sequence of `k` days (`calories[i] + calories[i+1] + ... + calories[i+k-1]`):
If `T < lower`, they performed poorly on their diet and lose 1 point; 
If `T > upper`, they performed well on their diet and gain 1 point;
Otherwise, they performed normally and there is no change in points.

Initially, the dieter has zero points. Return the total number of points the dieter has after dieting for `calories.length` days.

Note that the total points can be negative.


Example 1:
Input: calories = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1, lower = 3, upper = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: Since k = 1, we consider each element of the array separately and compare it to lower and upper.

calories[0] and calories[1] are less than lower so 2 points are lost.

calories[3] and calories[4] are greater than upper so 2 points are gained.


Example 2:
Input: calories = [3,2], k = 2, lower = 0, upper = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Since k = 2, we consider subarrays of length 2.

calories[0] + calories[1] > upper so 1 point is gained.


Example 3:
Input: calories = [6,5,0,0], k = 2, lower = 1, upper = 5
Output: 0
Explanation:
calories[0] + calories[1] > upper so 1 point is gained.

For each query `queries[i] = [left, right, k]`, we may rearrange the substring `s[left], ..., s[right]`, and then choose up to `k` of them to replace with any lowercase English letter. 
If the substring is possible to be a palindrome string after the operations above, the result of the query is `true`. Otherwise, the result is `false`.

Return an array `answer[]`, where `answer[i]` is the result of the `i`-th query `queries[i]`.

Note that: Each letter is counted individually for replacement so if for example `s[left..right] = ""aaa""`, and `k = 2`, we can only replace two of the letters.  (Also, note that the initial string `s` is never modified by any query.)

Example :
Input: s = ""abcda"", queries = [[3,3,0],[1,2,0],[0,3,1],[0,3,2],[0,4,1]]
Output: [true,false,false,true,true]
Explanation:
queries[0] : substring = ""d"", is palidrome.

queries[1] : substring = ""bc"", is not palidrome.

queries[2] : substring = ""abcd"", is not palidrome after replacing only 1 character.

queries[3] : substring = ""abcd"", could be changed to ""abba"" which is palidrome. Also this can be changed to ""baab"" first rearrange it ""bacd"" then replace ""cd"" with ""ab"".

1188,Design Bounded Blocking Queue,"Implement a thread-safe bounded blocking queue that has the following methods:
`BoundedBlockingQueue(int capacity)` The constructor initializes the queue with a maximum `capacity`.

`void enqueue(int element)` Adds an `element` to the front of the queue. If the queue is full, the calling thread is blocked until the queue is no longer full.

`int dequeue()` Returns the element at the rear of the queue and removes it. If the queue is empty, the calling thread is blocked until the queue is no longer empty.

`int size()` Returns the number of elements currently in the queue.

Your implementation will be tested using multiple threads at the same time. Each thread will either be a producer thread that only makes calls to the `enqueue` method or a consumer thread that only makes calls to the `dequeue` method. The `size` method will be called after every test case.

Please do not use built-in implementations of bounded blocking queue as this will not be accepted in an interview.


Example 1:
Input:
1
1
[""BoundedBlockingQueue"",""enqueue"",""dequeue"",""dequeue"",""enqueue"",""enqueue"",""enqueue"",""enqueue"",""dequeue""]
[[2],[1],[],[],[0],[2],[3],[4],[]]
Output:
[1,0,2,2]
Explanation:
Number of producer threads = 1
Number of consumer threads = 1
BoundedBlockingQueue queue = new BoundedBlockingQueue(2);   // initialize the queue with capacity = 2.

queue.enqueue(1);   // The producer thread enqueues 1 to the queue.

queue.dequeue();    // The consumer thread calls dequeue and returns 1 from the queue.

queue.dequeue();    // Since the queue is empty, the consumer thread is blocked.

queue.enqueue(0);   // The producer thread enqueues 0 to the queue. The consumer thread is unblocked and returns 0 from the queue.

queue.enqueue(2);   // The producer thread enqueues 2 to the queue.

queue.enqueue(3);   // The producer thread enqueues 3 to the queue.

queue.enqueue(4);   // The producer thread is blocked because the queue's capacity (2) is reached.

queue.dequeue();    // The consumer thread returns 2 from the queue. The producer thread is unblocked and enqueues 4 to the queue.

queue.size();       // 2 elements remaining in the queue. size() is always called at the end of each test case.


Example 2:
Input:
3
4
[""BoundedBlockingQueue"",""enqueue"",""enqueue"",""enqueue"",""dequeue"",""dequeue"",""dequeue"",""enqueue""]
[[3],[1],[0],[2],[],[],[],[3]]
Output:
[1,0,2,1]
Explanation:
Number of producer threads = 3
Number of consumer threads = 4
BoundedBlockingQueue queue = new BoundedBlockingQueue(3);   // initialize the queue with capacity = 3.

queue.enqueue(1);   // Producer thread P1 enqueues 1 to the queue.

queue.enqueue(0);   // Producer thread P2 enqueues 0 to the queue.

queue.enqueue(2);   // Producer thread P3 enqueues 2 to the queue.

queue.dequeue();    // Consumer thread C1 calls dequeue.

queue.dequeue();    // Consumer thread C2 calls dequeue.

queue.dequeue();    // Consumer thread C3 calls dequeue.

queue.enqueue(3);   // One of the producer threads enqueues 3 to the queue.

queue.size();       // 1 element remaining in the queue.

Since the number of threads for producer/consumer is greater than 1, we do not know how the threads will be scheduled in the operating system, even though the input seems to imply the ordering. Therefore, any of the output [1,0,2] or [1,2,0] or [0,1,2] or [0,2,1] or [2,0,1] or [2,1,0] will be accepted.

A Skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to `add`, `erase` and `search`. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists are just simple linked lists.

For example: we have a Skiplist containing `[30,40,50,60,70,90]` and we want to add `80` and `45` into it. The Skiplist works this way:
Artyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons
You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, `add` , `erase` and `search `can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).

To be specific, your design should include these functions:
`bool search(int target)` : Return whether the `target` exists in the Skiplist or not.

`void add(int num)`: Insert a value into the SkipList. 
`bool erase(int num)`: Remove a value in the Skiplist. If `num` does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exists multiple `num` values, removing any one of them is fine.

See more about Skiplist : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list
Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.

1210,Minimum Moves to Reach Target with Rotations,"In an `n*n` grid, there is a snake that spans 2 cells and starts moving from the top left corner at `(0, 0)` and `(0, 1)`. The grid has empty cells represented by zeros and blocked cells represented by ones. The snake wants to reach the lower right corner at `(n-1, n-2)` and `(n-1, n-1)`.

In one move the snake can:
Move one cell to the right if there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.

Move down one cell if there are no blocked cells there. This move keeps the horizontal/vertical position of the snake as it is.

Rotate clockwise if it's in a horizontal position and the two cells under it are both empty. In that case the snake moves from `(r, c)` and `(r, c+1)` to `(r, c)` and `(r+1, c)`.

Rotate counterclockwise if it's in a vertical position and the two cells to its right are both empty. In that case the snake moves from `(r, c)` and `(r+1, c)` to `(r, c)` and `(r, c+1)`.

Return the minimum number of moves to reach the target.

If there is no way to reach the target, return `-1`.

1226,The Dining Philosophers,"Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both forks.

Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.

Design a discipline of behaviour (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e., each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.

The problem statement and the image above are taken from wikipedia.org
The philosophers' ids are numbered from 0 to 4 in a clockwise order. Implement the function `void wantsToEat(philosopher, pickLeftFork, pickRightFork, eat, putLeftFork, putRightFork)` where:
`philosopher` is the id of the philosopher who wants to eat.

`pickLeftFork` and `pickRightFork` are functions you can call to pick the corresponding forks of that philosopher.

`eat` is a function you can call to let the philosopher eat once he has picked both forks.

`putLeftFork` and `putRightFork` are functions you can call to put down the corresponding forks of that philosopher.

The philosophers are assumed to be thinking as long as they are not asking to eat (the function is not being called with their number).

Five threads, each representing a philosopher, will simultaneously use one object of your class to simulate the process. The function may be called for the same philosopher more than once, even before the last call ends.


Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: [[4,2,1],[4,1,1],[0,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1],[2,0,3],[2,1,2],[2,2,2],[4,0,3],[4,1,2],[0,2,1],[4,2,2],[3,2,1],[3,1,1],[0,0,3],[0,1,2],[0,2,2],[1,2,1],[1,1,1],[3,0,3],[3,1,2],[3,2,2],[1,0,3],[1,1,2],[1,2,2]]
Explanation:
n is the number of times each philosopher will call the function.

The output array describes the calls you made to the functions controlling the forks and the eat function, its format is:
output[i] = [a, b, c] (three integers)
- a is the id of a philosopher.

1237,Find Positive Integer Solution for a Given Equation,"Given a callable function `f(x, y)` with a hidden formula and a value `z`, reverse engineer the formula and return all positive integer pairs `x` and `y` where `f(x,y) == z`. You may return the pairs in any order.

While the exact formula is hidden, the function is monotonically increasing, i.e.:
`f(x, y) < f(x + 1, y)`
`f(x, y) < f(x, y + 1)`
The function interface is defined like this:
interface CustomFunction {
public:
  // Returns some positive integer f(x, y) for two positive integers x and y based on a formula.

  int f(int x, int y);
};
We will judge your solution as follows:
The judge has a list of `9` hidden implementations of `CustomFunction`, along with a way to generate an answer key of all valid pairs for a specific `z`.

The judge will receive two inputs: a `function_id` (to determine which implementation to test your code with), and the target `z`.

The judge will call your `findSolution` and compare your results with the answer key.

If your results match the answer key, your solution will be `Accepted`.


Example 1:
Input: function_id = 1, z = 5
Output: [[1,4],[2,3],[3,2],[4,1]]
Explanation: The hidden formula for function_id = 1 is f(x, y) = x + y.

The following positive integer values of x and y make f(x, y) equal to 5:
x=1, y=4 -> f(1, 4) = 1 + 4 = 5.

x=2, y=3 -> f(2, 3) = 2 + 3 = 5.

x=3, y=2 -> f(3, 2) = 3 + 2 = 5.

x=4, y=1 -> f(4, 1) = 4 + 1 = 5.


Example 2:
Input: function_id = 2, z = 5
Output: [[1,5],[5,1]]
Explanation: The hidden formula for function_id = 2 is f(x, y) = x * y.

The following positive integer values of x and y make f(x, y) equal to 5:
x=1, y=5 -> f(1, 5) = 1 * 5 = 5.

x=5, y=1 -> f(5, 1) = 5 * 1 = 5.

1279,Traffic Light Controlled Intersection,"There is an intersection of two roads. First road is road A where cars travel from North to South in direction 1 and from South to North in direction 2. Second road is road B where cars travel from West to East in direction 3 and from East to West in direction 4.

There is a traffic light located on each road before the intersection. A traffic light can either be green or red.

Green means cars can cross the intersection in both directions of the road.

Red means cars in both directions cannot cross the intersection and must wait until the light turns green.

The traffic lights cannot be green on both roads at the same time. That means when the light is green on road A, it is red on road B and when the light is green on road B, it is red on road A.

Initially, the traffic light is green on road A and red on road B. When the light is green on one road, all cars can cross the intersection in both directions until the light becomes green on the other road. No two cars traveling on different roads should cross at the same time.

Design a deadlock-free traffic light controlled system at this intersection.

Implement the function `void carArrived(carId, roadId, direction, turnGreen, crossCar)` where:
`carId` is the id of the car that arrived.

`roadId` is the id of the road that the car travels on.

`direction` is the direction of the car.

`turnGreen` is a function you can call to turn the traffic light to green on the current road.

`crossCar` is a function you can call to let the current car cross the intersection.

Your answer is considered correct if it avoids cars deadlock in the intersection. Turning the light green on a road when it was already green is considered a wrong answer.


Example 1:
Input: cars = [1,3,5,2,4], directions = [2,1,2,4,3], arrivalTimes = [10,20,30,40,50]
Output: [
""Car 1 Has Passed Road A In Direction 2"",    // Traffic light on road A is green, car 1 can cross the intersection.

""Car 3 Has Passed Road A In Direction 1"",    // Car 3 crosses the intersection as the light is still green.

""Car 5 Has Passed Road A In Direction 2"",    // Car 5 crosses the intersection as the light is still green.

""Traffic Light On Road B Is Green"",          // Car 2 requests green light for road B.

""Car 2 Has Passed Road B In Direction 4"",    // Car 2 crosses as the light is green on road B now.

""Car 4 Has Passed Road B In Direction 3""     // Car 4 crosses the intersection as the light is still green.

Example 2:
Input: cars = [1,2,3,4,5], directions = [2,4,3,3,1], arrivalTimes = [10,20,30,40,40]
Output: [
""Car 1 Has Passed Road A In Direction 2"",    // Traffic light on road A is green, car 1 can cross the intersection.

""Car 2 Has Passed Road B In Direction 4"",    // Car 2 crosses as the light is green on road B now.

""Car 3 Has Passed Road B In Direction 3"",    // Car 3 crosses as the light is green on road B now.

""Traffic Light On Road A Is Green"",          // Car 5 requests green light for road A.

""Car 5 Has Passed Road A In Direction 1"",    // Car 5 crosses as the light is green on road A now.

""Traffic Light On Road B Is Green"",          // Car 4 requests green light for road B. Car 4 blocked until car 5 crosses and then traffic light is green on road B.

""Car 4 Has Passed Road B In Direction 3""     // Car 4 crosses as the light is green on road B now.

1333,"Filter Restaurants by Vegan-Friendly, Price and Distance","Given the array `restaurants` where  `restaurants[i] = [idi, ratingi, veganFriendlyi, pricei, distancei]`. You have to filter the restaurants using three filters.

The `veganFriendly` filter will be either true (meaning you should only include restaurants with `veganFriendlyi` set to true) or false (meaning you can include any restaurant). In addition, you have the filters `maxPrice` and `maxDistance` which are the maximum value for price and distance of restaurants you should consider respectively.

Return the array of restaurant IDs after filtering, ordered by rating from highest to lowest. For restaurants with the same rating, order them by id from highest to lowest. For simplicity `veganFriendlyi` and `veganFriendly` take value 1 when it is true, and 0 when it is false.


Example 1:
Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10

Restaurant 4 [id=4, rating=10, veganFriendly=0, price=10, distance=3]
Restaurant 5 [id=5, rating=1, veganFriendly=1, price=15, distance=1] 
After filter restaurants with veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50 and maxDistance = 10 we have restaurant 3, restaurant 1 and restaurant 5 (ordered by rating from highest to lowest).

1348,Tweet Counts Per Frequency,"A social media company is trying to monitor activity on their site by analyzing the number of tweets that occur in select periods of time. These periods can be partitioned into smaller time chunks based on a certain frequency (every minute, hour, or day).

For example, the period `[10, 10000]` (in seconds) would be partitioned into the following time chunks with these frequencies:
Every minute (60-second chunks): `[10,69]`, `[70,129]`, `[130,189]`, `...`, `[9970,10000]`
Every hour (3600-second chunks): `[10,3609]`, `[3610,7209]`, `[7210,10000]`
Every day (86400-second chunks): `[10,10000]`
Notice that the last chunk may be shorter than the specified frequency's chunk size and will always end with the end time of the period (`10000` in the above example).

Design and implement an API to help the company with their analysis.

Implement the `TweetCounts` class:
`TweetCounts()` Initializes the `TweetCounts` object.

`void recordTweet(String tweetName, int time)` Stores the `tweetName` at the recorded `time` (in seconds).

`List<Integer> getTweetCountsPerFrequency(String freq, String tweetName, int startTime, int endTime)` Returns a list of integers representing the number of tweets with `tweetName` in each time chunk for the given period of time `[startTime, endTime]` (in seconds) and frequency `freq`.

1366,Rank Teams by Votes,"In a special ranking system, each voter gives a rank from highest to lowest to all teams participated in the competition.

The ordering of teams is decided by who received the most position-one votes. If two or more teams tie in the first position, we consider the second position to resolve the conflict, if they tie again, we continue this process until the ties are resolved. If two or more teams are still tied after considering all positions, we rank them alphabetically based on their team letter.

Given an array of strings `votes` which is the votes of all voters in the ranking systems. Sort all teams according to the ranking system described above.

Return a string of all teams sorted by the ranking system.


Example 1:
Input: votes = [""ABC"",""ACB"",""ABC"",""ACB"",""ACB""]

Explanation: Team A was ranked first place by 5 voters. No other team was voted as first place so team A is the first team.

Team B was ranked second by 2 voters and was ranked third by 3 voters.

Team C was ranked second by 3 voters and was ranked third by 2 voters.

As most of the voters ranked C second, team C is the second team and team B is the third.


Example 2:
Input: votes = [""WXYZ"",""XYZW""]
Output: ""XWYZ""
Explanation: X is the winner due to tie-breaking rule. X has same votes as W for the first position but X has one vote as second position while W doesn't have any votes as second position. 

Example 3:
Input: votes = [""ZMNAGUEDSJYLBOPHRQICWFXTVK""]

1368,Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid,"Given a m x n `grid`. Each cell of the `grid` has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit if you are currently in this cell. The sign of `grid[i][j]` can be:
1 which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i][j + 1]`)
2 which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i][j - 1]`)
3 which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i + 1][j]`)
4 which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from `grid[i][j]` to `grid[i - 1][j]`)
Notice that there could be some invalid signs on the cells of the `grid` which points outside the `grid`.

You will initially start at the upper left cell `(0,0)`. A valid path in the grid is a path which starts from the upper left cell `(0,0)` and ends at the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)` following the signs on the grid. The valid path doesn't have to be the shortest.

You can modify the sign on a cell with `cost = 1`. You can modify the sign on a cell one time only.

Input: n = 6, headID = 2, manager = [2,2,-1,2,2,2], informTime = [0,0,1,0,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: The head of the company with id = 2 is the direct manager of all the employees in the company and needs 1 minute to inform them all.

The tree structure of the employees in the company is shown.


Example 3:
Input: n = 7, headID = 6, manager = [1,2,3,4,5,6,-1], informTime = [0,6,5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 21
Explanation: The head has id = 6. He will inform employee with id = 5 in 1 minute.

The employee with id = 5 will inform the employee with id = 4 in 2 minutes.

The employee with id = 4 will inform the employee with id = 3 in 3 minutes.

The employee with id = 3 will inform the employee with id = 2 in 4 minutes.

The employee with id = 2 will inform the employee with id = 1 in 5 minutes.

The employee with id = 1 will inform the employee with id = 0 in 6 minutes.

Needed time = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21.


Example 4:
Input: n = 15, headID = 0, manager = [-1,0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6], informTime = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first minute the head will inform employees 1 and 2.

The second minute they will inform employees 3, 4, 5 and 6.

The third minute they will inform the rest of employees.

1377,Frog Position After T Seconds,"Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `1` to `n`. A frog starts jumping from vertex 1. In one second, the frog jumps from its current vertex to another unvisited vertex if they are directly connected. The frog can not jump back to a visited vertex. In case the frog can jump to several vertices, it jumps randomly to one of them with the same probability. Otherwise, when the frog can not jump to any unvisited vertex, it jumps forever on the same vertex.

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` means that exists an edge connecting the vertices `ai` and `bi`.

Return the probability that after `t` seconds the frog is on the vertex `target`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,7],[2,4],[2,6],[3,5]], t = 2, target = 4
Output: 0.16666666666666666 
Explanation: The figure above shows the given graph. The frog starts at vertex 1, jumping with 1/3 probability to the vertex 2 after second 1 and then jumping with 1/2 probability to vertex 4 after second 2. Thus the probability for the frog is on the vertex 4 after 2 seconds is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6 = 0.16666666666666666. 

Example 2:
Input: n = 7, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,7],[2,4],[2,6],[3,5]], t = 1, target = 7
Output: 0.3333333333333333
Explanation: The figure above shows the given graph. The frog starts at vertex 1, jumping with 1/3 = 0.3333333333333333 probability to the vertex 7 after second 1.

1396,Design Underground System,"An underground railway system is keeping track of customer travel times between different stations. They are using this data to calculate the average time it takes to travel from one station to another.

Implement the `UndergroundSystem` class:
`void checkIn(int id, string stationName, int t)`
	
A customer with a card ID equal to `id`, checks in at the station `stationName` at time `t`.

A customer can only be checked into one place at a time.

`void checkOut(int id, string stationName, int t)`
	
A customer with a card ID equal to `id`, checks out from the station `stationName` at time `t`.

`double getAverageTime(string startStation, string endStation)`
	
Returns the average time it takes to travel from `startStation` to `endStation`.

The average time is computed from all the previous traveling times from `startStation` to `endStation` that happened directly, meaning a check in at `startStation` followed by a check out from `endStation`.

The time it takes to travel from `startStation` to `endStation` may be different from the time it takes to travel from `endStation` to `startStation`.

There will be at least one customer that has traveled from `startStation` to `endStation` before `getAverageTime` is called.

You may assume all calls to the `checkIn` and `checkOut` methods are consistent. If a customer checks in at time `t1` then checks out at time `t2`, then `t1 < t2`. All events happen in chronological order.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2 or 3 stones from the first remaining stones in the row.

The score of each player is the sum of values of the stones taken. The score of each player is 0 initially.

The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.

Return ""Alice"" if Alice will win, ""Bob"" if Bob will win or ""Tie"" if they end the game with the same score.


Example 1:
Input: values = [1,2,3,7]

Explanation: Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.


Example 2:
Input: values = [1,2,3,-9]
Output: ""Alice""
Explanation: Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.

If Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. The next move Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.

If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob's score becomes 3. The next move Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.

Remember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.

Explanation: The queries are processed as follow: 
For i=0: queries[i]=3, P=[1,2,3,4,5], position of 3 in P is 2, then we move 3 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[3,1,2,4,5]. 
For i=1: queries[i]=1, P=[3,1,2,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,3,2,4,5]. 
For i=2: queries[i]=2, P=[1,3,2,4,5], position of 2 in P is 2, then we move 2 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[2,1,3,4,5]. 
For i=3: queries[i]=1, P=[2,1,3,4,5], position of 1 in P is 1, then we move 1 to the beginning of P resulting in P=[1,2,3,4,5]. 
Therefore, the array containing the result is [2,1,2,1].

1427,Perform String Shifts,"You are given a string `s` containing lowercase English letters, and a matrix `shift`, where `shift[i] = [direction, amount]`:
`direction` can be `0` (for left shift) or `1` (for right shift). 
`amount` is the amount by which string `s` is to be shifted.

A left shift by 1 means remove the first character of `s` and append it to the end.

Similarly, a right shift by 1 means remove the last character of `s` and add it to the beginning.

Return the final string after all operations.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""abc"", shift = [[0,1],[1,2]]

1428,Leftmost Column with at Least a One,"(This problem is an interactive problem.)
A row-sorted binary matrix means that all elements are `0` or `1` and each row of the matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given a row-sorted binary matrix `binaryMatrix`, return the index (0-indexed) of the leftmost column with a 1 in it. If such an index does not exist, return `-1`.

You can't access the Binary Matrix directly. You may only access the matrix using a `BinaryMatrix` interface:
`BinaryMatrix.get(row, col)` returns the element of the matrix at index `(row, col)` (0-indexed).

`BinaryMatrix.dimensions()` returns the dimensions of the matrix as a list of 2 elements `[rows, cols]`, which means the matrix is `rows x cols`.

Submissions making more than `1000` calls to `BinaryMatrix.get` will be judged Wrong Answer. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

For custom testing purposes, the input will be the entire binary matrix `mat`. You will not have access to the binary matrix directly.

1463,Cherry Pickup II,"Given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` representing a field of cherries. Each cell in `grid` represents the number of cherries that you can collect.

You have two robots that can collect cherries for you, Robot #1 is located at the top-left corner (0,0) , and Robot #2 is located at the top-right corner (0, cols-1) of the grid.

Return the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots  by following the rules below:
From a cell (i,j), robots can move to cell (i+1, j-1) , (i+1, j) or (i+1, j+1).

When any robot is passing through a cell, It picks it up all cherries, and the cell becomes an empty cell (0).

When both robots stay on the same cell, only one of them takes the cherries.

Both robots cannot move outside of the grid at any moment.

Both robots should reach the bottom row in the `grid`.

1467,Probability of a Two Boxes Having The Same Number of Distinct Balls,"Given `2n` balls of `k` distinct colors. You will be given an integer array `balls` of size `k` where `balls[i]` is the number of balls of color `i`. 
All the balls will be shuffled uniformly at random, then we will distribute the first `n` balls to the first box and the remaining `n` balls to the other box (Please read the explanation of the second example carefully).

Please note that the two boxes are considered different. For example, if we have two balls of colors `a` and `b`, and two boxes `[]` and `()`, then the distribution `[a] (b)` is considered different than the distribution `[b] (a) `(Please read the explanation of the first example carefully).

We want to calculate the probability that the two boxes have the same number of distinct balls.


Example 1:
Input: balls = [1,1]
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: Only 2 ways to divide the balls equally:
- A ball of color 1 to box 1 and a ball of color 2 to box 2
- A ball of color 2 to box 1 and a ball of color 1 to box 2
In both ways, the number of distinct colors in each box is equal. The probability is 2/2 = 1

Example 2:
Input: balls = [2,1,1]
Output: 0.66667
Explanation: We have the set of balls [1, 1, 2, 3]
This set of balls will be shuffled randomly and we may have one of the 12 distinct shuffles with equale probability (i.e. 1/12):
[1,1 / 2,3], [1,1 / 3,2], [1,2 / 1,3], [1,2 / 3,1], [1,3 / 1,2], [1,3 / 2,1], [2,1 / 1,3], [2,1 / 3,1], [2,3 / 1,1], [3,1 / 1,2], [3,1 / 2,1], [3,2 / 1,1]
After that we add the first two balls to the first box and the second two balls to the second box.

We can see that 8 of these 12 possible random distributions have the same number of distinct colors of balls in each box.

Probability is 8/12 = 0.66667

Example 3:
Input: balls = [1,2,1,2]
Output: 0.60000
Explanation: The set of balls is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]. It is hard to display all the 180 possible random shuffles of this set but it is easy to check that 108 of them will have the same number of distinct colors in each box.

Probability = 108 / 180 = 0.6

Example 4:
Input: balls = [3,2,1]
Output: 0.30000
Explanation: The set of balls is [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]. It is hard to display all the 60 possible random shuffles of this set but it is easy to check that 18 of them will have the same number of distinct colors in each box.

Probability = 18 / 60 = 0.3

1471,The k Strongest Values in an Array,"Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`.

A value `arr[i]` is said to be stronger than a value `arr[j]` if `|arr[i] - m| > |arr[j] - m|` where `m` is the median of the array.

If `|arr[i] - m| == |arr[j] - m|`, then `arr[i]` is said to be stronger than `arr[j]` if `arr[i] > arr[j]`.

Return a list of the strongest `k` values in the array. return the answer in any arbitrary order.

Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. More formally, if the length of the list is n, the median is the element in position `((n - 1) / 2)` in the sorted list (0-indexed).

For `arr = [6, -3, 7, 2, 11]`, `n = 5` and the median is obtained by sorting the array `arr = [-3, 2, 6, 7, 11]` and the median is `arr[m]` where `m = ((5 - 1) / 2) = 2`. The median is `6`.

For `arr = [-7, 22, 17, 3]`, `n = 4` and the median is obtained by sorting the array `arr = [-7, 3, 17, 22]` and the median is `arr[m]` where `m = ((4 - 1) / 2) = 1`. The median is `3`.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [5,1]
Explanation: Median is 3, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [5,1,4,2,3]. The strongest 2 elements are [5, 1]. [1, 5] is also accepted answer.

Please note that although |5 - 3| == |1 - 3| but 5 is stronger than 1 because 5 > 1.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,1,3,5,5], k = 2
Output: [5,5]
Explanation: Median is 3, the elements of the array sorted by the strongest are [5,5,1,1,3]. The strongest 2 elements are [5, 5].


Example 3:
Input: arr = [6,7,11,7,6,8], k = 5

For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4. 
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2. 
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4. 
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.

1477,Find Two Non-overlapping Sub-arrays Each With Target Sum,"Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `target`.

You have to find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of `arr` each with sum equal `target`. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is minimum.

Return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or return -1 if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.


Example 1:
Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.


Example 3:
Input: arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6

We need to make `m` bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use `k` adjacent flowers from the garden.

The garden consists of `n` flowers, the `ith` flower will bloom in the `bloomDay[i]` and then can be used in exactly one bouquet.

Return the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make `m` bouquets from the garden. If it is impossible to make `m` bouquets return -1.


Example 1:
Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: Let's see what happened in the first three days. x means flower bloomed and _ means flower didn't bloom in the garden.

We need 3 bouquets each should contain 1 flower.

After day 1: [x, _, _, _, _]   // we can only make one bouquet.

After day 2: [x, _, _, _, x]   // we can only make two bouquets.

After day 3: [x, _, x, _, x]   // we can make 3 bouquets. The answer is 3.


Example 2:
Input: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: We need 3 bouquets each has 2 flowers, that means we need 6 flowers. We only have 5 flowers so it is impossible to get the needed bouquets and we return -1.


Example 3:
Input: bloomDay = [7,7,7,7,12,7,7], m = 2, k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: We need 2 bouquets each should have 3 flowers.

Here's the garden after the 7 and 12 days:
After day 7: [x, x, x, x, _, x, x]
We can make one bouquet of the first three flowers that bloomed. We cannot make another bouquet from the last three flowers that bloomed because they are not adjacent.

After day 12: [x, x, x, x, x, x, x]
It is obvious that we can make two bouquets in different ways.

1485,Clone Binary Tree With Random Pointer,"A binary tree is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the tree or null.

Return a deep copy of the tree.

The tree is represented in the same input/output way as normal binary trees where each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:
`val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
`random_index`: the index of the node (in the input) where the random pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

You will be given the tree in class `Node` and you should return the cloned tree in class `NodeCopy`. `NodeCopy` class is just a clone of `Node` class with the same attributes and constructors.


Example 1:
Input: root = [[1,null],null,[4,3],[7,0]]
Output: [[1,null],null,[4,3],[7,0]]
Explanation: The original binary tree is [1,null,4,7].

The random pointer of node one is null, so it is represented as [1, null].

The random pointer of node 4 is node 7, so it is represented as [4, 3] where 3 is the index of node 7 in the array representing the tree.

The random pointer of node 7 is node 1, so it is represented as [7, 0] where 0 is the index of node 1 in the array representing the tree.


Example 2:
Input: root = [[1,4],null,[1,0],null,[1,5],[1,5]]

""pes"" --> not assigned before, remains ""pes""
""fifa"" --> not assigned before, remains ""fifa""
""gta"" --> not assigned before, remains ""gta""
""pes(2019)"" --> not assigned before, remains ""pes(2019)""

Example 2:
Input: names = [""gta"",""gta(1)"",""gta"",""avalon""]

Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
""gta"" --> not assigned before, remains ""gta""
""gta(1)"" --> not assigned before, remains ""gta(1)""
""gta"" --> the name is reserved, system adds (k), since ""gta(1)"" is also reserved, systems put k = 2. it becomes ""gta(2)""
""avalon"" --> not assigned before, remains ""avalon""

Input: names = [""onepiece"",""onepiece(1)"",""onepiece(2)"",""onepiece(3)"",""onepiece""]
Output: [""onepiece"",""onepiece(1)"",""onepiece(2)"",""onepiece(3)"",""onepiece(4)""]
Explanation: When the last folder is created, the smallest positive valid k is 4, and it becomes ""onepiece(4)"".

If it rains over a lake which is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid the flood in any lake.

Given an integer array `rains` where:
`rains[i] > 0` means there will be rains over the `rains[i]` lake.

`rains[i] == 0` means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.

Return an array `ans` where:
`ans.length == rains.length`
`ans[i] == -1` if `rains[i] > 0`.

`ans[i]` is the lake you choose to dry in the `ith` day if `rains[i] == 0`.

If there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.

Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes. (see example 4)

Example 1:
Input: rains = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day full lakes are [1,2,3]
After the fourth day full lakes are [1,2,3,4]
There's no day to dry any lake and there is no flood in any lake.


Example 2:

Output: [-1,-1,2,1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day, we dry lake 2. Full lakes are [1]
After the fourth day, we dry lake 1. There is no full lakes.

After the fifth day, full lakes are [2].

After the sixth day, full lakes are [1,2].

It is easy that this scenario is flood-free. [-1,-1,1,2,-1,-1] is another acceptable scenario.

Input: rains = [1,2,0,1,2]
Output: []
Explanation: After the second day, full lakes are  [1,2]. We have to dry one lake in the third day.

After that, it will rain over lakes [1,2]. It's easy to prove that no matter which lake you choose to dry in the 3rd day, the other one will flood.

1489,Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree,"Given a weighted undirected connected graph with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes `ai` and `bi`. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.

Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.


Example 1:
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]
Output: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.

The following figure shows all the possible MSTs:
Notice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.

The edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.


Example 2:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]
Output: [[],[0,1,2,3]]
Explanation: We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.

1500,Design a File Sharing System,"We will use a file-sharing system to share a very large file which consists of `m` small chunks with IDs from `1` to `m`.

When users join the system, the system should assign a unique ID to them. The unique ID should be used once for each user, but when a user leaves the system, the ID can be reused again.

Users can request a certain chunk of the file, the system should return a list of IDs of all the users who own this chunk. If the user receive a non-empty list of IDs, they receive the requested chunk successfully.

Implement the `FileSharing` class:
`FileSharing(int m)` Initializes the object with a file of `m` chunks.

`int join(int[] ownedChunks)`: A new user joined the system owning some chunks of the file, the system should assign an id to the user which is the smallest positive integer not taken by any other user. Return the assigned id.

`void leave(int userID)`: The user with `userID` will leave the system, you cannot take file chunks from them anymore.

`int[] request(int userID, int chunkID)`: The user `userID` requested the file chunk with `chunkID`. Return a list of the IDs of all users that own this chunk sorted in ascending order.

Follow-ups:
What happens if the system identifies the user by their IP address instead of their unique ID and users disconnect and connect from the system with the same IP?
If the users in the system join and leave the system frequently without requesting any chunks, will your solution still be efficient?
If all each user join the system one time, request all files and then leave, will your solution still be efficient?
If the system will be used to share `n` files where the `ith` file consists of `m[i]`, what are the changes you have to do?

The driver code will pass the array to `findRoot`, and your function should find and return the root `Node` object in the array.

The driver code will take the returned `Node` object and serialize it. If the serialized value and the input data are the same, the test passes.


Example 1:
Input: tree = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Explanation: The tree from the input data is shown above.

The driver code creates the tree and gives findRoot the Node objects in an arbitrary order.

For example, the passed array could be [Node(5),Node(4),Node(3),Node(6),Node(2),Node(1)] or [Node(2),Node(6),Node(1),Node(3),Node(5),Node(4)].

The findRoot function should return the root Node(1), and the driver code will serialize it and compare with the input data.

The input data and serialized Node(1) are the same, so the test passes.


Example 2:
Input: tree = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]

Initially, there are `n` stones in a pile.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer `n`. Return `True` if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return `False`, assuming both players play optimally.


Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.


Example 2:
Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).

The company knows the positions of all the customers in this city on a 2D-Map and wants to build the new centre in a position such that the sum of the euclidean distances to all customers is minimum.

Given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [xi, yi]` is the position of the `ith` customer on the map, return the minimum sum of the euclidean distances to all customers.

In other words, you need to choose the position of the service centre `[xcentre, ycentre]` such that the following formula is minimized:
Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value will be accepted.


Example 1:
Input: positions = [[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: 4.00000
Explanation: As shown, you can see that choosing [xcentre, ycentre] = [1, 1] will make the distance to each customer = 1, the sum of all distances is 4 which is the minimum possible we can achieve.


Example 2:
Input: positions = [[1,1],[3,3]]
Output: 2.82843
Explanation: The minimum possible sum of distances = sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) = 2.82843

Example 3:
Input: positions = [[1,1]]
Output: 0.00000

Example 4:
Input: positions = [[1,1],[0,0],[2,0]]
Output: 2.73205
Explanation: At the first glance, you may think that locating the centre at [1, 0] will achieve the minimum sum, but locating it at [1, 0] will make the sum of distances = 3.

Try to locate the centre at [1.0, 0.5773502711] you will see that the sum of distances is 2.73205.

1516,Move Sub-Tree of N-Ary Tree,"Given the `root` of an N-ary tree of unique values, and two nodes of the tree `p` and `q`.

You should move the subtree of the node `p` to become a direct child of node `q`. If `p` is already a direct child of `q`, don't change anything. Node `p` must be the last child in the children list of node `q`.

Return the root of the tree after adjusting it.

There are 3 cases for nodes `p` and `q`:
Node `q` is in the sub-tree of node `p`.

Node `p` is in the sub-tree of node `q`.

Neither node `p` is in the sub-tree of node `q` nor node `q` is in the sub-tree of node `p`.

In cases 2 and 3, you just need to move `p` (with its sub-tree) to be a child of `q`, but in case 1 the tree may be disconnected, thus you need to reconnect the tree again. Please read the examples carefully before solving this problem.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

For example, the above tree is serialized as [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14].


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 4, q = 1
Output: [1,null,2,3,4,null,5,null,6,null,7,8]
Explanation: This example follows the second case as node p is in the sub-tree of node q. We move node p with its sub-tree to be a direct child of node q.

Notice that node 4 is the last child of node 1.


Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 7, q = 4
Output: [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8]
Explanation: Node 7 is already a direct child of node 4. We don't change anything.


Example 3:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 3, q = 8
Output: [1,null,2,null,4,5,null,7,8,null,null,null,3,null,6]
Explanation: This example follows case 3 because node p is not in the sub-tree of node q and vice-versa. We can move node 3 with its sub-tree and make it as node 8's child.


Example 4:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 2, q = 7
Output: [1,null,7,3,null,2,null,6,null,4,5,null,null,8]
Explanation: Node q is in the sub-tree of node p, so this is case 1.

The first step, we move node p (with all of its sub-tree except for node q) and add it as a child to node q.

Then we will see that the tree is disconnected, you need to reconnect node q to replace node p as shown.


Example 5:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,null,4,5,null,6,null,7,8], p = 1, q = 2
Output: [2,null,4,5,1,null,7,8,null,null,3,null,null,null,6]
Explanation: Node q is in the sub-tree of node p, so this is case 1.

The first step, we move node p (with all of its sub-tree except for node q) and add it as a child to node q.

As node p was the root of the tree, node q replaces it and becomes the root of the tree.


Constraints:

Node 1 has a label 'b'. The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1,4 and 5, as nodes 4 and 5 have different labels than node 1, the answer is just 1 (the node itself).


Example 2:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,3]], labels = ""bbbb""
Output: [4,2,1,1]
Explanation: The sub-tree of node 2 contains only node 2, so the answer is 1.

The sub-tree of node 3 contains only node 3, so the answer is 1.

The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1 and 2, both have label 'b', thus the answer is 2.

The substrings do not overlap, that is for any two substrings `s[i..j]` and `s[k..l]`, either `j < k` or `i > l` is true.

A substring that contains a certain character `c` must also contain all occurrences of `c`.

Find the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions. If there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, return the one with minimum total length. It can be shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length.

Notice that you can return the substrings in any order.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""adefaddaccc""

Explanation: The following are all the possible substrings that meet the conditions:
[
  ""adefaddaccc""
  ""adefadda"",
  ""ef"",
  ""e"",
  ""f"",
  ""ccc"",
]
If we choose the first string, we cannot choose anything else and we'd get only 1. If we choose ""adefadda"", we are left with ""ccc"" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to choose ""ef"" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose [""e"",""f"",""ccc""] which gives us 3 substrings. No other solution of the same number of substrings exist.

1531,String Compression II,"Run-length encoding is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string `""aabccc""` we replace `""aa""` by `""a2""` and replace `""ccc""` by `""c3""`. Thus the compressed string becomes `""a2bc3""`.

Notice that in this problem, we are not adding `'1'` after single characters.

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You need to delete at most `k` characters from `s` such that the run-length encoded version of `s` has minimum length.

Find the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of `s` after deleting at most `k` characters.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""aaabcccd"", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Compressing s without deleting anything will give us ""a3bc3d"" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = ""abcccd"" which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be ""a3c3"" of length 4.


Example 2:
Input: s = ""aabbaa"", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be ""a4"" of length 2.


Example 3:
Input: s = ""aaaaaaaaaaa"", k = 0
Output: 3
Explanation: Since k is zero, we cannot delete anything. The compressed string is ""a11"" of length 3.

You will not be given direct access to the array, instead, you will have an API `ArrayReader` which have the following functions:
`int compareSub(int l, int r, int x, int y)`: where `0 <= l, r, x, y < ArrayReader.length()`, `l <= r and` `x <= y`. The function compares the sum of sub-array `arr[l..r]` with the sum of the sub-array `arr[x..y]` and returns:
	
1 if `arr[l]+arr[l+1]+...+arr[r] > arr[x]+arr[x+1]+...+arr[y]`.

What if there is one number that is bigger than other numbers and one number that is smaller than other numbers?

Example 1:
Input: arr = [7,7,7,7,10,7,7,7]
Output: 4
Explanation: The following calls to the API
reader.compareSub(0, 0, 1, 1) // returns 0 this is a query comparing the sub-array (0, 0) with the sub array (1, 1), (i.e. compares arr[0] with arr[1]).

Thus we know that arr[0] and arr[1] doesn't contain the largest element.

reader.compareSub(2, 2, 3, 3) // returns 0, we can exclude arr[2] and arr[3].

reader.compareSub(4, 4, 5, 5) // returns 1, thus for sure arr[4] is the largest element in the array.

1540,Can Convert String in K Moves,"Given two strings `s` and `t`, your goal is to convert `s` into `t` in `k` moves or less.

During the `ith` (`1 <= i <= k`) move you can:
Choose any index `j` (1-indexed) from `s`, such that `1 <= j <= s.length` and `j` has not been chosen in any previous move, and shift the character at that index `i` times.

Do nothing.

Shifting a character means replacing it by the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that `'z'` becomes `'a'`). Shifting a character by `i` means applying the shift operations `i` times.

Remember that any index `j` can be picked at most once.

Return `true` if it's possible to convert `s` into `t` in no more than `k` moves, otherwise return `false`.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""input"", t = ""ouput"", k = 9
Output: true
Explanation: In the 6th move, we shift 'i' 6 times to get 'o'. And in the 7th move we shift 'n' to get 'u'.


Example 2:
Input: s = ""abc"", t = ""bcd"", k = 10
Output: false
Explanation: We need to shift each character in s one time to convert it into t. We can shift 'a' to 'b' during the 1st move. However, there is no way to shift the other characters in the remaining moves to obtain t from s.


Example 3:
Input: s = ""aab"", t = ""bbb"", k = 27

1541,Minimum Insertions to Balance a Parentheses String,"Given a parentheses string `s` containing only the characters `'('` and `')'`. A parentheses string is balanced if:
Any left parenthesis `'('` must have a corresponding two consecutive right parenthesis `'))'`.

Left parenthesis `'('` must go before the corresponding two consecutive right parenthesis `'))'`.

In other words, we treat `'('` as openning parenthesis and `'))'` as closing parenthesis.

For example, `""())""`, `""())(())))""` and `""(())())))""` are balanced, `"")()""`, `""()))""` and `""(()))""` are not balanced.

You can insert the characters `'('` and `')'` at any position of the string to balance it if needed.

Return the minimum number of insertions needed to make `s` balanced.

1547,Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick,"Given a wooden stick of length `n` units. The stick is labelled from `0` to `n`. For example, a stick of length 6 is labelled as follows:
Given an integer array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` denotes a position you should perform a cut at.

You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.

The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.

Return the minimum total cost of the cuts.


Example 1:
Input: n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]
Output: 16
Explanation: Using cuts order = [1, 3, 4, 5] as in the input leads to the following scenario:
The first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.

Rearranging the cuts to be [3, 5, 1, 4] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).


Example 2:
Input: n = 9, cuts = [5,6,1,4,2]
Output: 22
Explanation: If you try the given cuts ordering the cost will be 25.

1559,Detect Cycles in 2D Grid,"Given a 2D array of characters `grid` of size `m x n`, you need to find if there exists any cycle consisting of the same value in `grid`.

A cycle is a path of length 4 or more in the grid that starts and ends at the same cell. From a given cell, you can move to one of the cells adjacent to it - in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right), if it has the same value of the current cell.

Also, you cannot move to the cell that you visited in your last move. For example, the cycle `(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1)` is invalid because from `(1, 2)` we visited `(1, 1)` which was the last visited cell.

Return `true` if any cycle of the same value exists in `grid`, otherwise, return `false`.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[""a"",""a"",""a"",""a""],[""a"",""b"",""b"",""a""],[""a"",""b"",""b"",""a""],[""a"",""a"",""a"",""a""]]

For example, round 1 starts at sector `rounds[0]` and ends at sector `rounds[1]`
Return an array of the most visited sectors sorted in ascending order.

Notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the counter-clockwise direction (See the first example).


Example 1:

1563,Stone Game V,"There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array `stoneValue`.

In each round of the game, Alice divides the row into two non-empty rows (i.e. left row and right row), then Bob calculates the value of each row which is the sum of the values of all the stones in this row. Bob throws away the row which has the maximum value, and Alice's score increases by the value of the remaining row. If the value of the two rows are equal, Bob lets Alice decide which row will be thrown away. The next round starts with the remaining row.

The game ends when there is only one stone remaining. Alice's is initially zero.

Return the maximum score that Alice can obtain.


Example 1:
Input: stoneValue = [6,2,3,4,5,5]
Output: 18
Explanation: In the first round, Alice divides the row to [6,2,3], [4,5,5]. The left row has the value 11 and the right row has value 14. Bob throws away the right row and Alice's score is now 11.

In the second round Alice divides the row to [6], [2,3]. This time Bob throws away the left row and Alice's score becomes 16 (11 + 5).

1564,Put Boxes Into the Warehouse I,"You are given two arrays of positive integers, `boxes` and `warehouse`, representing the heights of some boxes of unit width and the heights of `n` rooms in a warehouse respectively. The warehouse's rooms are labelled from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right where `warehouse[i]` (0-indexed) is the height of the `ith` room.

Boxes are put into the warehouse by the following rules:
Boxes cannot be stacked.

You can rearrange the insertion order of the boxes.

Boxes can only be pushed into the warehouse from left to right only.

If the height of some room in the warehouse is less than the height of a box, then that box and all other boxes behind it will be stopped before that room.

Return the maximum number of boxes you can put into the warehouse.


Example 1:
Input: boxes = [4,3,4,1], warehouse = [5,3,3,4,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
We can first put the box of height 1 in room 4. Then we can put the box of height 3 in either of the 3 rooms 1, 2, or 3. Lastly, we can put one box of height 4 in room 0.

There is no way we can fit all 4 boxes in the warehouse.


Example 2:
Input: boxes = [1,2,2,3,4], warehouse = [3,4,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Notice that it's not possible to put the box of height 4 into the warehouse since it cannot pass the first room of height 3.

Also, for the last two rooms, 2 and 3, only boxes of height 1 can fit.

We can fit 3 boxes maximum as shown above. The yellow box can also be put in room 2 instead.

Swapping the orange and green boxes is also valid, or swapping one of them with the red box.


Example 3:

Explanation: The pattern (4) of length 1 is repeated 4 consecutive times. Notice that pattern can be repeated k or more times but not less.


Example 2:
Input: arr = [1,2,1,2,1,1,1,3], m = 2, k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: The pattern (1,2) of length 2 is repeated 2 consecutive times. Another valid pattern (2,1) is also repeated 2 times.


Example 3:
Input: arr = [1,2,1,2,1,3], m = 2, k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: The pattern (1,2) is of length 2 but is repeated only 2 times. There is no pattern of length 2 that is repeated 3 or more times.


Example 4:
Input: arr = [1,2,3,1,2], m = 2, k = 2

Moving from city `i` to city `j` reduces the amount of fuel you have by `|locations[i] - locations[j]|`. Please notice that `|x|` denotes the absolute value of `x`.

Notice that `fuel` cannot become negative at any point in time, and that you are allowed to visit any city more than once (including `start` and `finish`).

Return the count of all possible routes from `start` to `finish`.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: locations = [2,3,6,8,4], start = 1, finish = 3, fuel = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The following are all possible routes, each uses 5 units of fuel:
1 -> 3
1 -> 2 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 3
1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3

Example 2:
Input: locations = [4,3,1], start = 1, finish = 0, fuel = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: The following are all possible routes:
1 -> 0, used fuel = 1
1 -> 2 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 3
1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0, used fuel = 5

Example 3:
Input: locations = [5,2,1], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: It's impossible to get from 0 to 2 using only 3 units of fuel since the shortest route needs 4 units of fuel.


Example 4:
Input: locations = [2,1,5], start = 0, finish = 0, fuel = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two possible routes, 0 and 0 -> 1 -> 0.


Example 5:
Input: locations = [1,2,3], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 40
Output: 615088286
Explanation: The total number of possible routes is 2615088300. Taking this number modulo 10^9 + 7 gives us 615088286.


Constraints:
`2 <= locations.length <= 100`

Type 1: Can be traversed by Alice only.

Type 2: Can be traversed by Bob only.

Type 3: Can by traversed by both Alice and Bob.

Given an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [typei, ui, vi]` represents a bidirectional edge of type `typei` between nodes `ui` and `vi`, find the maximum number of edges you can remove so that after removing the edges, the graph can still be fully traversed by both Alice and Bob. The graph is fully traversed by Alice and Bob if starting from any node, they can reach all other nodes.

Return the maximum number of edges you can remove, or return `-1` if it's impossible for the graph to be fully traversed by Alice and Bob.


Example 1:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,3],[1,2,4],[1,1,2],[2,3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: If we remove the 2 edges [1,1,2] and [1,1,3]. The graph will still be fully traversable by Alice and Bob. Removing any additional edge will not make it so. So the maximum number of edges we can remove is 2.


Example 2:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[3,1,2],[3,2,3],[1,1,4],[2,1,4]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Notice that removing any edge will not make the graph fully traversable by Alice and Bob.

The warehouse's rooms are labeled from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right where `warehouse[i]` (0-indexed) is the height of the `ith` room.

Boxes are put into the warehouse by the following rules:
Boxes cannot be stacked.

You can rearrange the insertion order of the boxes.

Boxes can be pushed into the warehouse from either side (left or right)
If the height of some room in the warehouse is less than the height of a box, then that box and all other boxes behind it will be stopped before that room.

Return the maximum number of boxes you can put into the warehouse.


Example 1:
Input: boxes = [1,2,2,3,4], warehouse = [3,4,1,2]

Explanation:
We can store the boxes in the following order:
1- Put the yellow box in room 2 from either the left or right side.

2- Put the orange box in room 3 from the right side.

3- Put the green box in room 1 from the left side.

4- Put the red box in room 0 from the left side.

Notice that there are other valid ways to put 4 boxes such as swapping the red and green boxes or the red and orange boxes.


Example 2:
Input: boxes = [3,5,5,2], warehouse = [2,1,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
It's not possible to put the two boxes of height 5 in the warehouse since there's only 1 room of height >= 5.

For each person `i`, `preferences[i]` contains a list of friends sorted in the order of preference. In other words, a friend earlier in the list is more preferred than a friend later in the list. Friends in each list are denoted by integers from `0` to `n-1`.

All the friends are divided into pairs. The pairings are given in a list `pairs`, where `pairs[i] = [xi, yi]` denotes `xi` is paired with `yi` and `yi` is paired with `xi`.

However, this pairing may cause some of the friends to be unhappy. A friend `x` is unhappy if `x` is paired with `y` and there exists a friend `u` who is paired with `v` but:

1590,Make Sum Divisible by P,"Given an array of positive integers `nums`, remove the smallest subarray (possibly empty) such that the sum of the remaining elements is divisible by `p`. It is not allowed to remove the whole array.

Return the length of the smallest subarray that you need to remove, or `-1` if it's impossible.

A subarray is defined as a contiguous block of elements in the array.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,1,4,2], p = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The sum of the elements in nums is 10, which is not divisible by 6. We can remove the subarray [4], and the sum of the remaining elements is 6, which is divisible by 6.


Example 2:
Input: nums = [6,3,5,2], p = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: We cannot remove a single element to get a sum divisible by 9. The best way is to remove the subarray [5,2], leaving us with [6,3] with sum 9.


Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3], p = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: Here the sum is 6. which is already divisible by 3. Thus we do not need to remove anything.


Example 4:
Input: nums = [1,2,3], p = 7
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no way to remove a subarray in order to get a sum divisible by 7.

On each turn, the printer will print a solid rectangular pattern of a single color on the grid. This will cover up the existing colors in the rectangle.

Once the printer has used a color for the above operation, the same color cannot be used again.

You are given a `m x n` matrix `targetGrid`, where `targetGrid[row][col]` is the color in the position `(row, col)` of the grid.

Return `true` if it is possible to print the matrix `targetGrid`, otherwise, return `false`.


Example 1:
Input: targetGrid = [[1,1,1,1],[1,2,2,1],[1,2,2,1],[1,1,1,1]]

Rearrange the spaces so that there is an equal number of spaces between every pair of adjacent words and that number is maximized. If you cannot redistribute all the spaces equally, place the extra spaces at the end, meaning the returned string should be the same length as `text`.

Return the string after rearranging the spaces.


Example 1:
Input: text = ""  this   is  a sentence ""
Output: ""this   is   a   sentence""
Explanation: There are a total of 9 spaces and 4 words. We can evenly divide the 9 spaces between the words: 9 / (4-1) = 3 spaces.


Example 2:
Input: text = "" practice   makes   perfect""
Output: ""practice   makes   perfect ""
Explanation: There are a total of 7 spaces and 3 words. 7 / (3-1) = 3 spaces plus 1 extra space. We place this extra space at the end of the string.

You can split string `s` into any list of non-empty substrings, where the concatenation of the substrings forms the original string. However, you must split the substrings such that all of them are unique.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

1595,Minimum Cost to Connect Two Groups of Points,"You are given two groups of points where the first group has `size1` points, the second group has `size2` points, and `size1 >= size2`.

The `cost` of the connection between any two points are given in an `size1 x size2` matrix where `cost[i][j]` is the cost of connecting point `i` of the first group and point `j` of the second group. The groups are connected if each point in both groups is connected to one or more points in the opposite group. In other words, each point in the first group must be connected to at least one point in the second group, and each point in the second group must be connected to at least one point in the first group.

Return the minimum cost it takes to connect the two groups.


Example 1:
Input: cost = [[15, 96], [36, 2]]
Output: 17
Explanation: The optimal way of connecting the groups is:
1--A
2--B
This results in a total cost of 17.


Example 2:

1597,Build Binary Expression Tree From Infix Expression,"A binary expression tree is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with 2 children) correspond to the operators `'+'` (addition), `'-'` (subtraction), `'*'` (multiplication), and `'/'` (division).

For each internal node with operator `o`, the infix expression that it represents is `(A o B)`, where `A` is the expression the left subtree represents and `B` is the expression the right subtree represents.

You are given a string `s`, an infix expression containing operands, the operators described above, and parentheses `'('` and `')'`.

Return any valid binary expression tree, which its in-order traversal reproduces `s` after omitting the parenthesis from it (see examples below).

Please note that order of operations applies in `s`. That is, expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, and multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.

Operands must also appear in the same order in both `s` and the in-order traversal of the tree.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""3*4-2*5""
Output: [-,*,*,3,4,2,5]
Explanation: The tree above is the only valid tree whose inorder traversal produces s.


Example 2:
Input: s = ""2-3/(5*2)+1""
Output: [+,-,1,2,/,null,null,null,null,3,*,null,null,5,2]
Explanation: The inorder traversal of the tree above is 2-3/5*2+1 which is the same as s without the parenthesis. The tree also produces the correct result and its operands are in the same order as they appear in s.

The tree below is also a valid binary expression tree with the same inorder traversal as s, but it not a valid answer because it does not evaluate to the same value.

The third tree below is also not valid. Although it produces the same result and is equivalent to the above trees, its inorder traversal does not produce s and its operands are not in the same order as s.

You are given an array `customers` of length `n` where `customers[i]` is the number of new customers arriving just before the `ith` rotation (0-indexed). This means you must rotate the wheel `i` times before the `customers[i]` customers arrive. You cannot make customers wait if there is room in the gondola. Each customer pays `boardingCost` dollars when they board on the gondola closest to the ground and will exit once that gondola reaches the ground again.

You can stop the wheel at any time, including before serving all customers. If you decide to stop serving customers, all subsequent rotations are free in order to get all the customers down safely. Note that if there are currently more than four customers waiting at the wheel, only four will board the gondola, and the rest will wait for the next rotation.

Return the minimum number of rotations you need to perform to maximize your profit. If there is no scenario where the profit is positive, return `-1`.

1600,Throne Inheritance,"A kingdom consists of a king, his children, his grandchildren, and so on. Every once in a while, someone in the family dies or a child is born.

The kingdom has a well-defined order of inheritance that consists of the king as the first member. Let's define the recursive function `Successor(x, curOrder)`, which given a person `x` and the inheritance order so far, returns who should be the next person after `x` in the order of inheritance.

Successor(x, curOrder):
    if x has no children or all of x's children are in curOrder:
        if x is the king return null
        else return Successor(x's parent, curOrder)
    else return x's oldest child who's not in curOrder
For example, assume we have a kingdom that consists of the king, his children Alice and Bob (Alice is older than Bob), and finally Alice's son Jack.

In the beginning, `curOrder` will be `[""king""]`.

Calling `Successor(king, curOrder)` will return Alice, so we append to `curOrder` to get `[""king"", ""Alice""]`.

Calling `Successor(Alice, curOrder)` will return Jack, so we append to `curOrder` to get `[""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack""]`.

Calling `Successor(Jack, curOrder)` will return Bob, so we append to `curOrder` to get `[""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""]`.

Calling `Successor(Bob, curOrder)` will return `null`. Thus the order of inheritance will be `[""king"", ""Alice"", ""Jack"", ""Bob""]`.

Using the above function, we can always obtain a unique order of inheritance.

Implement the `ThroneInheritance` class:
`ThroneInheritance(string kingName)` Initializes an object of the `ThroneInheritance` class. The name of the king is given as part of the constructor.

`void birth(string parentName, string childName)` Indicates that `parentName` gave birth to `childName`.

`void death(string name)` Indicates the death of `name`. The death of the person doesn't affect the `Successor` function nor the current inheritance order. You can treat it as just marking the person as dead.

`string[] getInheritanceOrder()` Returns a list representing the current order of inheritance excluding dead people.

1606,Find Servers That Handled Most Number of Requests,"You have `k` servers numbered from `0` to `k-1` that are being used to handle multiple requests simultaneously. Each server has infinite computational capacity but cannot handle more than one request at a time. The requests are assigned to servers according to a specific algorithm:
The `ith` (0-indexed) request arrives.

If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).

If the `(i % k)th` server is available, assign the request to that server.

Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping around the list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary). For example, if the `ith` server is busy, try to assign the request to the `(i+1)th` server, then the `(i+2)th` server, and so on.

You are given a strictly increasing array `arrival` of positive integers, where `arrival[i]` represents the arrival time of the `ith` request, and another array `load`, where `load[i]` represents the load of the `ith` request (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the busiest server(s). A server is considered busiest if it handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.

Return a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the busiest server(s). You may return the IDs in any order.


Example 1:
Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,5], load = [5,2,3,3,3] 
Output: [1] 
Explanation:
All of the servers start out available.

The first 3 requests are handled by the first 3 servers in order.

Request 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next available server, which is 1.

Request 4 comes in. It cannot be handled since all servers are busy, so it is dropped.

Servers 0 and 2 handled one request each, while server 1 handled two requests. Hence server 1 is the busiest server.


Example 2:
Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4], load = [1,2,1,2]
Output: [0]
Explanation:
The first 3 requests are handled by first 3 servers.

Request 3 comes in. It is handled by server 0 since the server is available.

Server 0 handled two requests, while servers 1 and 2 handled one request each. Hence server 0 is the busiest server.


Example 3:
Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3], load = [10,12,11]
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation: Each server handles a single request, so they are all considered the busiest.

Notice that `x` does not have to be an element in `nums`.

Return `x` if the array is special, otherwise, return `-1`. It can be proven that if `nums` is special, the value for `x` is unique.

The root of the binary tree is at level index `0`, its children are at level index `1`, their children are at level index `2`, etc.

For every even-indexed level, all nodes at the level have odd integer values in strictly increasing order (from left to right).

For every odd-indexed level, all nodes at the level have even integer values in strictly decreasing order (from left to right).

Initially, you are facing directly east from your position. You cannot move from your position, but you can rotate. In other words, `posx` and `posy` cannot be changed. Your field of view in degrees is represented by `angle`, determining how wide you can see from any given view direction. Let `d` be the amount in degrees that you rotate counterclockwise.

Explaination: If either a or b are palindromes the answer is true since you can split in the following way:
aprefix = """", asuffix = ""x""
bprefix = """", bsuffix = ""y""
Then, aprefix + bsuffix = """" + ""y"" = ""y"", which is a palindrome.


Example 2:
Input: a = ""abdef"", b = ""fecab""

Example 3:
Input: a = ""ulacfd"", b = ""jizalu""

Explaination: Split them at index 3:
aprefix = ""ula"", asuffix = ""cfd""
bprefix = ""jiz"", bsuffix = ""alu""
Then, aprefix + bsuffix = ""ula"" + ""alu"" = ""ulaalu"", which is a palindrome.

1617,Count Subtrees With Max Distance Between Cities,"There are `n` cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are given an array `edges` of size `n-1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` represents a bidirectional edge between cities `ui` and `vi`. There exists a unique path between each pair of cities. In other words, the cities form a tree.

A subtree is a subset of cities where every city is reachable from every other city in the subset, where the path between each pair passes through only the cities from the subset. Two subtrees are different if there is a city in one subtree that is not present in the other.

For each `d` from `1` to `n-1`, find the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities in the subtree is equal to `d`.

Return an array of size `n-1` where the `dth` element (1-indexed) is the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities is equal to `d`.

Notice that the distance between the two cities is the number of edges in the path between them.


Example 1:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4]]
Output: [3,4,0]
Explanation:
The subtrees with subsets {1,2}, {2,3} and {2,4} have a max distance of 1.

The subtrees with subsets {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {2,3,4} and {1,2,3,4} have a max distance of 2.

No subtree has two nodes where the max distance between them is 3.

1618,Maximum Font to Fit a Sentence in a Screen,"You are given a string `text`. We want to display `text` on a screen of width `w` and height `h`. You can choose any font size from array `fonts`, which contains the available font sizes in ascending order.

You can use the `FontInfo` interface to get the width and height of any character at any available font size.

The `FontInfo` interface is defined as such:
interface FontInfo {
  // Returns the width of character ch on the screen using font size fontSize.

  // O(1) per call
  public int getWidth(int fontSize, char ch);
  // Returns the height of any character on the screen using font size fontSize.

  // O(1) per call
  public int getHeight(int fontSize);
}
The calculated width of `text` for some `fontSize` is the sum of every `getWidth(fontSize, text[i])` call for each `0 <= i < text.length` (0-indexed). The calculated height of `text` for some `fontSize` is `getHeight(fontSize)`. Note that `text` is displayed on a single line.

It is guaranteed that `FontInfo` will return the same value if you call `getHeight` or `getWidth` with the same parameters.

It is also guaranteed that for any font size `fontSize` and any character `ch`:
`getHeight(fontSize) <= getHeight(fontSize+1)`
`getWidth(fontSize, ch) <= getWidth(fontSize+1, ch)`
Return the maximum font size you can use to display `text` on the screen. If `text` cannot fit on the display with any font size, return `-1`.

1620,Coordinate With Maximum Network Quality,"You are given an array of network towers `towers` and an integer `radius`, where `towers[i] = [xi, yi, qi]` denotes the `ith` network tower with location `(xi, yi)` and quality factor `qi`. All the coordinates are integral coordinates on the X-Y plane, and the distance between two coordinates is the Euclidean distance.

The integer `radius` denotes the maximum distance in which the tower is reachable. The tower is reachable if the distance is less than or equal to `radius`. Outside that distance, the signal becomes garbled, and the tower is not reachable.

The signal quality of the `ith` tower at a coordinate `(x, y)` is calculated with the formula `⌊qi / (1 + d)⌋`, where `d` is the distance between the tower and the coordinate. The network quality at a coordinate is the sum of the signal qualities from all the reachable towers.

Return the integral coordinate where the network quality is maximum. If there are multiple coordinates with the same network quality, return the lexicographically minimum coordinate.

Note:
A coordinate `(x1, y1)` is lexicographically smaller than `(x2, y2)` if either `x1 < x2` or `x1 == x2` and `y1 < y2`.

`⌊val⌋` is the greatest integer less than or equal to `val` (the floor function).

Input: towers = [[1,2,5],[2,1,7],[3,1,9]], radius = 2
Output: [2,1]
Explanation: 
At coordinate (2, 1) the total quality is 13

- Quality of 5 from (1, 2) results in ⌊5 / (1 + sqrt(2)⌋ = ⌊2.07⌋ = 2
- Quality of 9 from (3, 1) results in ⌊9 / (1 + sqrt(1)⌋ = ⌊4.5⌋ = 4

Given the two integers, `n` and `threshold`, and an array of `queries`, you must determine for each `queries[i] = [ai, bi]` if cities `ai` and `bi` are connected directly or indirectly. (i.e. there is some path between them).

Return an array `answer`, where `answer.length == queries.length` and `answer[i]` is `true` if for the `ith` query, there is a path between `ai` and `bi`, or `answer[i]` is `false` if there is no path.

1628,Design an Expression Tree With Evaluate Function,"Given the `postfix` tokens of an arithmetic expression, build and return the binary expression tree that represents this expression.

Postfix notation is a notation for writing arithmetic expressions in which the operands (numbers) appear before their operators. For example, the postfix tokens of the expression `4*(5-(7+2))` are represented in the array `postfix = [""4"",""5"",""7"",""2"",""+"",""-"",""*""]`.

The class `Node` is an interface you should use to implement the binary expression tree. The returned tree will be tested using the `evaluate` function, which is supposed to evaluate the tree's value. You should not remove the `Node` class; however, you can modify it as you wish, and you can define other classes to implement it if needed.

A binary expression tree is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with two children) correspond to the operators `'+'` (addition), `'-'` (subtraction), `'*'` (multiplication), and `'/'` (division).

It's guaranteed that no subtree will yield a value that exceeds `109` in absolute value, and all the operations are valid (i.e., no division by zero).

Example 1:
Input: releaseTimes = [9,29,49,50], keysPressed = ""cbcd""
Output: ""c""
Explanation: The keypresses were as follows:
Keypress for 'c' had a duration of 9 (pressed at time 0 and released at time 9).

Keypress for 'b' had a duration of 29 - 9 = 20 (pressed at time 9 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 29).

Keypress for 'c' had a duration of 49 - 29 = 20 (pressed at time 29 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 49).

Keypress for 'd' had a duration of 50 - 49 = 1 (pressed at time 49 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 50).

The longest of these was the keypress for 'b' and the second keypress for 'c', both with duration 20.

'c' is lexicographically larger than 'b', so the answer is 'c'.


Example 2:
Input: releaseTimes = [12,23,36,46,62], keysPressed = ""spuda""
Output: ""a""
Explanation: The keypresses were as follows:
Keypress for 's' had a duration of 12.

Keypress for 'p' had a duration of 23 - 12 = 11.

Keypress for 'u' had a duration of 36 - 23 = 13.

Keypress for 'd' had a duration of 46 - 36 = 10.

Keypress for 'a' had a duration of 62 - 46 = 16.

The longest of these was the keypress for 'a' with duration 16.

1630,Arithmetic Subarrays,"A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least two elements, and the difference between every two consecutive elements is the same. More formally, a sequence `s` is arithmetic if and only if `s[i+1] - s[i] == s[1] - s[0] `for all valid `i`.

For example, these are arithmetic sequences:
1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9
The following sequence is not arithmetic:
1, 1, 2, 5, 7

Return a list of `boolean` elements `answer`, where `answer[i]` is `true` if the subarray `nums[l[i]], nums[l[i]+1], ... , nums[r[i]]` can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence, and `false` otherwise.


Example 1:
Input: nums = `[4,6,5,9,3,7]`, l = `[0,0,2]`, r = `[2,3,5]`

You are given `heights`, a 2D array of size `rows x columns`, where `heights[row][col]` represents the height of cell `(row, col)`. You are situated in the top-left cell, `(0, 0)`, and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, `(rows-1, columns-1)` (i.e., 0-indexed). You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.

A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.


Example 1:
Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.

This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.


Example 2:

1632,Rank Transform of a Matrix,"Given an `m x n` `matrix`, return a new matrix `answer` where `answer[row][col]` is the rank of `matrix[row][col]`.

The rank is an integer that represents how large an element is compared to other elements. It is calculated using the following rules:
The rank is an integer starting from `1`.

If two elements `p` and `q` are in the same row or column, then:
	
If `p < q` then `rank(p) < rank(q)`
If `p == q` then `rank(p) == rank(q)`
If `p > q` then `rank(p) > rank(q)`
The rank should be as small as possible.

It is guaranteed that `answer` is unique under the given rules.


Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [[1,2],[2,3]]
Explanation:
The rank of matrix[0][0] is 1 because it is the smallest integer in its row and column.

The rank of matrix[0][1] is 2 because matrix[0][1] > matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0] is rank 1.

The rank of matrix[1][0] is 2 because matrix[1][0] > matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0] is rank 1.

The rank of matrix[1][1] is 3 because matrix[1][1] > matrix[0][1], matrix[1][1] > matrix[1][0], and both matrix[0][1] and matrix[1][0] are rank 2.

1634,Add Two Polynomials Represented as Linked Lists,"A polynomial linked list is a special type of linked list where every node represents a term in a polynomial expression.

Each node has three attributes:
`coefficient`: an integer representing the number multiplier of the term. The coefficient of the term `9x4` is `9`.

`power`: an integer representing the exponent. The power of the term `9x4` is `4`.

`next`: a pointer to the next node in the list, or `null` if it is the last node of the list.

For example, the polynomial `5x3 + 4x - 7` is represented by the polynomial linked list illustrated below:
The polynomial linked list must be in its standard form: the polynomial must be in strictly descending order by its `power` value. Also, terms with a `coefficient` of `0` are omitted.

Given two polynomial linked list heads, `poly1` and `poly2`, add the polynomials together and return the head of the sum of the polynomials.

`PolyNode` format:
The input/output format is as a list of `n` nodes, where each node is represented as its `[coefficient, power]`. For example, the polynomial `5x3 + 4x - 7` would be represented as: `[[5,3],[4,1],[-7,0]]`.


Example 1:
Input: poly1 = [[1,1]], poly2 = [[1,0]]

Your task is to form `target` using the given `words` under the following rules:
`target` should be formed from left to right.

To form the `ith` character (0-indexed) of `target`, you can choose the `kth` character of the `jth` string in `words` if `target[i] = words[j][k]`.

Once you use the `kth` character of the `jth` string of `words`, you can no longer use the `xth` character of any string in `words` where `x <= k`. In other words, all characters to the left of or at index `k` become unusuable for every string.

Repeat the process until you form the string `target`.

Notice that you can use multiple characters from the same string in `words` provided the conditions above are met.

Return the number of ways to form `target` from `words`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.

1648,Sell Diminishing-Valued Colored Balls,"You have an `inventory` of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants `orders` balls of any color.

The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls of that color you currently have in your `inventory`. For example, if you own `6` yellow balls, the customer would pay `6` for the first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only `5` yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at `5` (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).

You are given an integer array, `inventory`, where `inventory[i]` represents the number of balls of the `ith` color that you initially own. You are also given an integer `orders`, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the balls in any order.

Return the maximum total value that you can attain after selling `orders` colored balls. As the answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: inventory = [2,5], orders = 4
Output: 14
Explanation: Sell the 1st color 1 time (2) and the 2nd color 3 times (5 + 4 + 3).

- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (0 * 30) (0 neighbors) = 120
- Extrovert at (1,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
- Extrovert at (2,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
The grid happiness is 120 + 60 + 60 = 240.

The above figure shows the grid in this example with each person's happiness. The introvert stays in the light green cell while the extroverts live on the light purple cells.


Example 2:
Input: m = 3, n = 1, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1
Output: 260
Explanation: Place the two introverts in (1,1) and (3,1) and the extrovert at (2,1).

- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 * 20) (2 neighbors) = 80
- Introvert at (3,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
The grid happiness is 90 + 80 + 90 = 260.

Input: m = 2, n = 2, introvertsCount = 4, extrovertsCount = 0

1660,Correct a Binary Tree,"You have a binary tree with a small defect. There is exactly one invalid node where its right child incorrectly points to another node at the same depth but to the invalid node's right.

Given the root of the binary tree with this defect, `root`, return the root of the binary tree after removing this invalid node and every node underneath it (minus the node it incorrectly points to).

Custom testing:
The test input is read as 3 lines:
`TreeNode root`
`int fromNode` (not available to `correctBinaryTree`)
`int toNode` (not available to `correctBinaryTree`)
After the binary tree rooted at `root` is parsed, the `TreeNode` with value of `fromNode` will have its right child pointer pointing to the `TreeNode` with a value of `toNode`. Then, `root` is passed to `correctBinaryTree`.


Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3], fromNode = 2, toNode = 3
Output: [1,null,3]
Explanation: The node with value 2 is invalid, so remove it.

The numeric value of a string consisting of lowercase characters is defined as the sum of its characters' numeric values. For example, the numeric value of the string `""abe""` is equal to `1 + 2 + 5 = 8`.

You are given two integers `n` and `k`. Return the lexicographically smallest string with length equal to `n` and numeric value equal to `k`.

Note that a string `x` is lexicographically smaller than string `y` if `x` comes before `y` in dictionary order, that is, either `x` is a prefix of `y`, or if `i` is the first position such that `x[i] != y[i]`, then `x[i]` comes before `y[i]` in alphabetic order.

1664,Ways to Make a Fair Array,"You are given an integer array `nums`. You can choose exactly one index (0-indexed) and remove the element. Notice that the index of the elements may change after the removal.

For example, if `nums = [6,1,7,4,1]`:
Choosing to remove index `1` results in `nums = [6,7,4,1]`.

Choosing to remove index `2` results in `nums = [6,1,4,1]`.

Choosing to remove index `4` results in `nums = [6,1,7,4]`.

An array is fair if the sum of the odd-indexed values equals the sum of the even-indexed values.

Return the number of indices that you could choose such that after the removal, `nums` is fair. 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,1,6,4]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Remove index 0: [1,6,4] -> Even sum: 1 + 4 = 5. Odd sum: 6. Not fair.

Remove index 1: [2,6,4] -> Even sum: 2 + 4 = 6. Odd sum: 6. Fair.

Remove index 2: [2,1,4] -> Even sum: 2 + 4 = 6. Odd sum: 1. Not fair.

1665,Minimum Initial Energy to Finish Tasks,"You are given an array `tasks` where `tasks[i] = [actuali, minimumi]`:
`actuali` is the actual amount of energy you spend to finish the `ith` task.

`minimumi` is the minimum amount of energy you require to begin the `ith` task.

For example, if the task is `[10, 12]` and your current energy is `11`, you cannot start this task. However, if your current energy is `13`, you can complete this task, and your energy will be `3` after finishing it.

You can finish the tasks in any order you like.

Return the minimum initial amount of energy you will need to finish all the tasks.

`void pushFront(int val)` Adds `val` to the front of the queue.

`void pushMiddle(int val)` Adds `val` to the middle of the queue.

`void pushBack(int val)` Adds `val` to the back of the queue.

Explanation: In 1 move, you can change nums to [1,2,2,3] (underlined elements are changed).

nums[0] + nums[3] = 1 + 3 = 4.

nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 2 = 4.

Extending the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: ""The lowest common ancestor of `n` nodes `p1`, `p2`, ..., `pn` in a binary tree `T` is the lowest node that has every `pi` as a descendant (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself) for every valid `i`"". A descendant of a node `x` is a node `y` that is on the path from node `x` to some leaf node.

There are `n` stones in a pile. On each player's turn, they can remove a stone from the pile and receive points based on the stone's value. Alice and Bob may value the stones differently.

You are given two integer arrays of length `n`, `aliceValues` and `bobValues`. Each `aliceValues[i]` and `bobValues[i]` represents how Alice and Bob, respectively, value the `ith` stone.

The winner is the person with the most points after all the stones are chosen. If both players have the same amount of points, the game results in a draw. Both players will play optimally. Both players know the other's values.

1687,Delivering Boxes from Storage to Ports,"You have the task of delivering some boxes from storage to their ports using only one ship. However, this ship has a limit on the number of boxes and the total weight that it can carry.

You are given an array `boxes`, where `boxes[i] = [ports​​i​, weighti]`, and three integers `portsCount`, `maxBoxes`, and `maxWeight`.

`ports​​i` is the port where you need to deliver the `ith` box and `weightsi` is the weight of the `ith` box.

`portsCount` is the number of ports.

`maxBoxes` and `maxWeight` are the respective box and weight limits of the ship.

The boxes need to be delivered in the order they are given. The ship will follow these steps:
The ship will take some number of boxes from the `boxes` queue, not violating the `maxBoxes` and `maxWeight` constraints.

For each loaded box in order, the ship will make a trip to the port the box needs to be delivered to and deliver it. If the ship is already at the correct port, no trip is needed, and the box can immediately be delivered.

The ship then makes a return trip to storage to take more boxes from the queue.

The ship must end at storage after all the boxes have been delivered.

Return the minimum number of trips the ship needs to make to deliver all boxes to their respective ports.


Example 1:
Input: boxes = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]], portsCount = 2, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes all the boxes in the queue, goes to port 1, then port 2, then port 1 again, then returns to storage. 4 trips.

So the total number of trips is 4.

Note that the first and third boxes cannot be delivered together because the boxes need to be delivered in order (i.e. the second box needs to be delivered at port 2 before the third box).


Example 2:
Input: boxes = [[1,2],[3,3],[3,1],[3,1],[2,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the second, third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.


Example 3:
Input: boxes = [[1,4],[1,2],[2,1],[2,1],[3,2],[3,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 6, maxWeight = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows:
- The ship takes the first and second boxes, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 2, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the fifth and sixth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.

So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.


Example 4:
Input: boxes = [[2,4],[2,5],[3,1],[3,2],[3,7],[3,1],[4,4],[1,3],[5,2]], portsCount = 5, maxBoxes = 5, maxWeight = 7
Output: 14
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows:
- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 2, then storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the second box, goes to port 2, then storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 3, then storage. 2 trips.

- The ship takes the sixth and seventh boxes, goes to port 3, then port 4, then storage. 3 trips. 
- The ship takes the eighth and ninth boxes, goes to port 1, then port 5, then storage. 3 trips.

So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 14.

1692,Count Ways to Distribute Candies,"There are `n` unique candies (labeled `1` through `n`) and `k` bags. You are asked to distribute all the candies into the bags such that every bag has at least one candy.

There can be multiple ways to distribute the candies. Two ways are considered different if the candies in one bag in the first way are not all in the same bag in the second way. The order of the bags and the order of the candies within each bag do not matter.

For example, `(1), (2,3)` and `(2), (1,3)` are considered different because candies `2` and `3` in the bag `(2,3)` in the first way are not in the same bag in the second way (they are split between the bags `(2)` and `(1,3)`). However, `(1), (2,3)` and `(3,2), (1)` are considered the same because the candies in each bag are all in the same bags in both ways.

Given two integers, `n` and `k`, return the number of different ways to distribute the candies. As the answer may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: You can distribute 3 candies into 2 bags in 3 ways:
(1), (2,3)
(1,2), (3)
(1,3), (2)

Example 2:
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: You can distribute 4 candies into 2 bags in 7 ways:
(1), (2,3,4)
(1,2), (3,4)
(1,3), (2,4)
(1,4), (2,3)
(1,2,3), (4)

Example 3:
Input: n = 20, k = 5
Output: 206085257

1694,Reformat Phone Number,"You are given a phone number as a string `number`. `number` consists of digits, spaces `' '`, and/or dashes `'-'`.

You would like to reformat the phone number in a certain manner. Firstly, remove all spaces and dashes. Then, group the digits from left to right into blocks of length 3 until there are 4 or fewer digits. The final digits are then grouped as follows:
2 digits: A single block of length 2.

3 digits: A single block of length 3.

4 digits: Two blocks of length 2 each.

The blocks are then joined by dashes. Notice that the reformatting process should never produce any blocks of length 1 and produce at most two blocks of length 2.

Return the phone number after formatting.


Example 1:
Input: number = ""1-23-45 6""
Output: ""123-456""
Explanation: The digits are ""123456"".

Step 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is ""123"".

Step 2: There are 3 digits remaining, so put them in a single block of length 3. The 2nd block is ""456"".

Joining the blocks gives ""123-456"".


Example 2:
Input: number = ""123 4-567""
Output: ""123-45-67""
Explanation: The digits are ""1234567"".

Step 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is ""123"".

Step 2: There are 4 digits left, so split them into two blocks of length 2. The blocks are ""45"" and ""67"".

Joining the blocks gives ""123-45-67"".


Example 3:
Input: number = ""123 4-5678""
Output: ""123-456-78""
Explanation: The digits are ""12345678"".

Step 1: The 1st block is ""123"".

Step 2: The 2nd block is ""456"".

Step 3: There are 2 digits left, so put them in a single block of length 2. The 3rd block is ""78"".

Explanation: The above figure shows the given graph. Note that there are two overlapping edges between 0 and 1 with distances 2 and 16.

For the first query, between 0 and 1 there is no path where each distance is less than 2, thus we return false for this query.

1700,Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch,"The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to by numbers `0` and `1` respectively. All students stand in a queue. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.

The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The sandwiches are placed in a stack. At each step:
If the student at the front of the queue prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue.

Otherwise, they will leave it and go to the queue's end.

This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.

You are given two integer arrays `students` and `sandwiches` where `sandwiches[i]` is the type of the `i​​​​​​th` sandwich in the stack (`i = 0` is the top of the stack) and `students[j]` is the preference of the `j​​​​​​th` student in the initial queue (`j = 0` is the front of the queue). Return the number of students that are unable to eat.


Example 1:
Input: students = [1,1,0,0], sandwiches = [0,1,0,1]
Output: 0 
Explanation:
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,0,0,1].

- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [0,0,1,1].

- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [0,1,1] and sandwiches = [1,0,1].

- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,1,0].

- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [1,0] and sandwiches = [0,1].

- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [0,1].

1701,Average Waiting Time,"There is a restaurant with a single chef. You are given an array `customers`, where `customers[i] = [arrivali, timei]:`
`arrivali` is the arrival time of the `ith` customer. The arrival times are sorted in non-decreasing order.

`timei` is the time needed to prepare the order of the `ith` customer.

When a customer arrives, he gives the chef his order, and the chef starts preparing it once he is idle. The customer waits till the chef finishes preparing his order. The chef does not prepare food for more than one customer at a time. The chef prepares food for customers in the order they were given in the input.

Return the average waiting time of all customers. Solutions within `10-5` from the actual answer are considered accepted.


Example 1:
Input: customers = [[1,2],[2,5],[4,3]]
Output: 5.00000
Explanation:
1) The first customer arrives at time 1, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 1, and finishes at time 3, so the waiting time of the first customer is 3 - 1 = 2.

2) The second customer arrives at time 2, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 3, and finishes at time 8, so the waiting time of the second customer is 8 - 2 = 6.

3) The third customer arrives at time 4, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 8, and finishes at time 11, so the waiting time of the third customer is 11 - 4 = 7.

So the average waiting time = (2 + 6 + 7) / 3 = 5.


Example 2:
Input: customers = [[5,2],[5,4],[10,3],[20,1]]
Output: 3.25000
Explanation:
1) The first customer arrives at time 5, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 5, and finishes at time 7, so the waiting time of the first customer is 7 - 5 = 2.

2) The second customer arrives at time 5, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 7, and finishes at time 11, so the waiting time of the second customer is 11 - 5 = 6.

3) The third customer arrives at time 10, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it at time 11, and finishes at time 14, so the waiting time of the third customer is 14 - 10 = 4.

4) The fourth customer arrives at time 20, the chef takes his order and starts preparing it immediately at time 20, and finishes at time 21, so the waiting time of the fourth customer is 21 - 20 = 1.

So the average waiting time = (2 + 6 + 4 + 1) / 4 = 3.25.

1728,Cat and Mouse II,"A game is played by a cat and a mouse named Cat and Mouse.

The environment is represented by a `grid` of size `rows x cols`, where each element is a wall, floor, player (Cat, Mouse), or food.

Players are represented by the characters `'C'`(Cat)`,'M'`(Mouse).

Floors are represented by the character `'.'` and can be walked on.

Walls are represented by the character `'#'` and cannot be walked on.

Food is represented by the character `'F'` and can be walked on.

There is only one of each character `'C'`, `'M'`, and `'F'` in `grid`.

Mouse and Cat play according to the following rules:
Mouse moves first, then they take turns to move.

During each turn, Cat and Mouse can jump in one of the four directions (left, right, up, down). They cannot jump over the wall nor outside of the `grid`.

`catJump, mouseJump` are the maximum lengths Cat and Mouse can jump at a time, respectively. Cat and Mouse can jump less than the maximum length.

Staying in the same position is allowed.

Mouse can jump over Cat.

The game can end in 4 ways:
If Cat occupies the same position as Mouse, Cat wins.

If Cat reaches the food first, Cat wins.

If Mouse reaches the food first, Mouse wins.

If Mouse cannot get to the food within 1000 turns, Cat wins.

You play a game with the following rules:
You start eating candies on day `0`.

You cannot eat any candy of type `i` unless you have eaten all candies of type `i - 1`.

You must eat at least one candy per day until you have eaten all the candies.

Construct a boolean array `answer` such that `answer.length == queries.length` and `answer[i]` is `true` if you can eat a candy of type `favoriteTypei` on day `favoriteDayi` without eating more than `dailyCapi` candies on any day, and `false` otherwise. Note that you can eat different types of candy on the same day, provided that you follow rule 2.

Return the constructed array `answer`.


Example 1:
Input: candiesCount = [7,4,5,3,8], queries = [[0,2,2],[4,2,4],[2,13,1000000000]]
Output: [true,false,true]
Explanation:
1- If you eat 2 candies (type 0) on day 0 and 2 candies (type 0) on day 1, you will eat a candy of type 0 on day 2.

2- You can eat at most 4 candies each day.

   If you eat 4 candies every day, you will eat 4 candies (type 0) on day 0 and 4 candies (type 0 and type 1) on day 1.

   On day 2, you can only eat 4 candies (type 1 and type 2), so you cannot eat a candy of type 4 on day 2.

3- If you eat 1 candy each day, you will eat a candy of type 2 on day 13.


Example 2:
Input: candiesCount = [5,2,6,4,1], queries = [[3,1,2],[4,10,3],[3,10,100],[4,100,30],[1,3,1]]

Each turn you choose two different non-empty piles, take one stone from each, and add `1` point to your score. The game stops when there are fewer than two non-empty piles (meaning there are no more available moves).

Given three integers `a`​​​​​, `b`,​​​​​ and `c`​​​​​, return the maximum score you can get.


Example 1:
Input: a = 2, b = 4, c = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The starting state is (2, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)

1754,Largest Merge Of Two Strings,"You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct a string `merge` in the following way: while either `word1` or `word2` are non-empty, choose one of the following options:
If `word1` is non-empty, append the first character in `word1` to `merge` and delete it from `word1`.

	
For example, if `word1 = ""abc"" `and `merge = ""dv""`, then after choosing this operation, `word1 = ""bc""` and `merge = ""dva""`.

If `word2` is non-empty, append the first character in `word2` to `merge` and delete it from `word2`.

	
For example, if `word2 = ""abc"" `and `merge = """"`, then after choosing this operation, `word2 = ""bc""` and `merge = ""a""`.

Return the lexicographically largest `merge` you can construct.

A string `a` is lexicographically larger than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, `a` has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in `b`. For example, `""abcd""` is lexicographically larger than `""abcc""` because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and `d` is greater than `c`.


Example 1:
Input: word1 = ""cabaa"", word2 = ""bcaaa""
Output: ""cbcabaaaaa""
Explanation: One way to get the lexicographically largest merge is:
- Take from word1: merge = ""c"", word1 = ""abaa"", word2 = ""bcaaa""
- Take from word2: merge = ""cb"", word1 = ""abaa"", word2 = ""caaa""
- Take from word2: merge = ""cbc"", word1 = ""abaa"", word2 = ""aaa""

Return the minimum possible value of `abs(sum - goal)`.

Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements (possibly all or none) of the original array.


Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,-7,3,5], goal = 6

1762,Buildings With an Ocean View,"There are `n` buildings in a line. You are given an integer array `heights` of size `n` that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.

Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.


Example 1:
Input: heights = [4,2,3,1]
Output: [0,2,3]
Explanation: Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.

1763,Longest Nice Substring,"A string `s` is nice if, for every letter of the alphabet that `s` contains, it appears both in uppercase and lowercase. For example, `""abABB""` is nice because `'A'` and `'a'` appear, and `'B'` and `'b'` appear. However, `""abA""` is not because `'b'` appears, but `'B'` does not.

Given a string `s`, return the longest substring of `s` that is nice. If there are multiple, return the substring of the earliest occurrence. If there are none, return an empty string.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""YazaAay""
Output: ""aAa""
Explanation: ""aAa"" is a nice string because 'A/a' is the only letter of the alphabet in s, and both 'A' and 'a' appear.

""aAa"" is the longest nice substring.


Example 2:
Input: s = ""Bb""
Output: ""Bb""
Explanation: ""Bb"" is a nice string because both 'B' and 'b' appear. The whole string is a substring.

1764,Form Array by Concatenating Subarrays of Another Array,"You are given a 2D integer array `groups` of length `n`. You are also given an integer array `nums`.

You are asked if you can choose `n` disjoint subarrays from the array `nums` such that the `ith` subarray is equal to `groups[i]` (0-indexed), and if `i > 0`, the `(i-1)th` subarray appears before the `ith` subarray in `nums` (i.e. the subarrays must be in the same order as `groups`).

Return `true` if you can do this task, and `false` otherwise.

Note that the subarrays are disjoint if and only if there is no index `k` such that `nums[k]` belongs to more than one subarray. A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.


Example 1:
Input: groups = [[1,-1,-1],[3,-2,0]], nums = [1,-1,0,1,-1,-1,3,-2,0]
Output: true
Explanation: You can choose the 0th subarray as [1,-1,0,1,-1,-1,3,-2,0] and the 1st one as [1,-1,0,1,-1,-1,3,-2,0].

These subarrays are disjoint as they share no common nums[k] element.


Example 2:
Input: groups = [[10,-2],[1,2,3,4]], nums = [1,2,3,4,10,-2]
Output: false
Explanation: Note that choosing the subarrays [1,2,3,4,10,-2] and [1,2,3,4,10,-2] is incorrect because they are not in the same order as in groups.

[10,-2] must come before [1,2,3,4].


Example 3:
Input: groups = [[1,2,3],[3,4]], nums = [7,7,1,2,3,4,7,7]

If `isWater[i][j] == 0`, cell `(i, j)` is a land cell.

If `isWater[i][j] == 1`, cell `(i, j)` is a water cell.

You must assign each cell a height in a way that follows these rules:
The height of each cell must be non-negative.

If the cell is a water cell, its height must be `0`.

Any two adjacent cells must have an absolute height difference of at most `1`. A cell is adjacent to another cell if the former is directly north, east, south, or west of the latter (i.e., their sides are touching).

Find an assignment of heights such that the maximum height in the matrix is maximized.

Return an integer matrix `height` of size `m x n` where `height[i][j]` is cell `(i, j)`'s height. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.


Example 1:
Input: isWater = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: [[1,0],[2,1]]
Explanation: The image shows the assigned heights of each cell.

To represent this tree, you are given an integer array `nums` and a 2D array `edges`. Each `nums[i]` represents the `ith` node's value, and each `edges[j] = [uj, vj]` represents an edge between nodes `uj` and `vj` in the tree.

Two values `x` and `y` are coprime if `gcd(x, y) == 1` where `gcd(x, y)` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.

An ancestor of a node `i` is any other node on the shortest path from node `i` to the root. A node is not considered an ancestor of itself.

Return an array `ans` of size `n`, where `ans[i]` is the closest ancestor to node `i` such that `nums[i]` and `nums[ans[i]]` are coprime, or `-1` if there is no such ancestor.

Explanation: In the above figure, each node's value is in parentheses.

- Node 0 has no coprime ancestors.

- Node 1 has only one ancestor, node 0. Their values are coprime (gcd(2,3) == 1).

- Node 2 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. Node 1's value is not coprime (gcd(3,3) == 3), but node 0's
  value is (gcd(2,3) == 1), so node 0 is the closest valid ancestor.

- Node 3 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. It is coprime with node 1 (gcd(3,2) == 1), so node 1 is its

1778,Shortest Path in a Hidden Grid,"This is an interactive problem.

There is a robot in a hidden grid, and you are trying to get it from its starting cell to the target cell in this grid. The grid is of size `m x n`, and each cell in the grid is either empty or blocked. It is guaranteed that the starting cell and the target cell are different, and neither of them is blocked.

You want to find the minimum distance to the target cell. However, you do not know the grid's dimensions, the starting cell, nor the target cell. You are only allowed to ask queries to the `GridMaster` object.

Thr `GridMaster` class has the following functions:
`boolean canMove(char direction)` Returns `true` if the robot can move in that direction. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

`void move(char direction)` Moves the robot in that direction. If this move would move the robot to a blocked cell or off the grid, the move will be ignored, and the robot will remain in the same position.

`boolean isTarget()` Returns `true` if the robot is currently on the target cell. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Note that `direction` in the above functions should be a character from `{'U','D','L','R'}`, representing the directions up, down, left, and right, respectively.

Return the minimum distance between the robot's initial starting cell and the target cell. If there is no valid path between the cells, return `-1`.

Custom testing:
The test input is read as a 2D matrix `grid` of size `m x n` where:
`grid[i][j] == -1` indicates that the robot is in cell `(i, j)` (the starting cell).

`grid[i][j] == 0` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is blocked.

`grid[i][j] == 1` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is empty.

`grid[i][j] == 2` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is the target cell.

There is exactly one `-1` and `2` in `grid`. Remember that you will not have this information in your code.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[1,2],[-1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible interaction is described below:
The robot is initially standing on cell (1, 0), denoted by the -1.

- master.canMove('U') returns true.

- master.canMove('D') returns false.

- master.canMove('L') returns false.

- master.canMove('R') returns false.

- master.move('U') moves the robot to the cell (0, 0).

- master.isTarget() returns false.

- master.canMove('U') returns false.

- master.canMove('D') returns true.

- master.canMove('L') returns false.

- master.canMove('R') returns true.

- master.move('R') moves the robot to the cell (0, 1).

- master.isTarget() returns true. 
We now know that the target is the cell (0, 1), and the shortest path to the target cell is 2.


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[0,0,-1],[1,1,1],[2,0,0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The minimum distance between the robot and the target cell is 4.

`renew(string tokenId, int currentTime)` renews the unexpired token with the given `tokenId` at the given `currentTime` in seconds. If there are no unexpired tokens with the given `tokenId`, the request is ignored, and nothing happens.

`countUnexpiredTokens(int currentTime)` returns the number of unexpired tokens at the given currentTime.

Note that if a token expires at time `t`, and another action happens on time `t` (`renew` or `countUnexpiredTokens`), the expiration takes place before the other actions.

Explanation
AuthenticationManager authenticationManager = new AuthenticationManager(5); // Constructs the AuthenticationManager with `timeToLive` = 5 seconds.

authenticationManager.`renew`(""aaa"", 1); // No token exists with tokenId ""aaa"" at time 1, so nothing happens.

authenticationManager.generate(""aaa"", 2); // Generates a new token with tokenId ""aaa"" at time 2.

authenticationManager.`countUnexpiredTokens`(6); // The token with tokenId ""aaa"" is the only unexpired one at time 6, so return 1.

authenticationManager.generate(""bbb"", 7); // Generates a new token with tokenId ""bbb"" at time 7.

authenticationManager.`renew`(""aaa"", 8); // The token with tokenId ""aaa"" expired at time 7, and 8 >= 7, so at time 8 the `renew` request is ignored, and nothing happens.

authenticationManager.`renew`(""bbb"", 10); // The token with tokenId ""bbb"" is unexpired at time 10, so the `renew` request is fulfilled and now the token will expire at time 15.

authenticationManager.`countUnexpiredTokens`(15); // The token with tokenId ""bbb"" expires at time 15, and the token with tokenId ""aaa"" expired at time 7, so currently no token is unexpired, so return 0.

1801,Number of Orders in the Backlog,"You are given a 2D integer array `orders`, where each `orders[i] = [pricei, amounti, orderTypei]` denotes that `amounti` orders have been placed of type `orderTypei` at the price `pricei`. The `orderTypei` is:
`0` if it is a batch of `buy` orders, or
`1` if it is a batch of `sell` orders.

Note that `orders[i]` represents a batch of `amounti` independent orders with the same price and order type. All orders represented by `orders[i]` will be placed before all orders represented by `orders[i+1]` for all valid `i`.

There is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:
If the order is a `buy` order, you look at the `sell` order with the smallest price in the backlog. If that `sell` order's price is smaller than or equal to the current `buy` order's price, they will match and be executed, and that `sell` order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the `buy` order is added to the backlog.

Vice versa, if the order is a `sell` order, you look at the `buy` order with the largest price in the backlog. If that `buy` order's price is larger than or equal to the current `sell` order's price, they will match and be executed, and that `buy` order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the `sell` order is added to the backlog.

Return the total amount of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input. Since this number can be large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.


Example 1:
Input: orders = [[10,5,0],[15,2,1],[25,1,1],[30,4,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
- 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are added to the backlog.

- 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.

- 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.

- 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is added to the backlog.

Finally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total number of orders in the backlog is 6.


Example 2:
Input: orders = [[7,1000000000,1],[15,3,0],[5,999999995,0],[5,1,1]]
Output: 999999984
Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
- 109 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are added to the backlog.

- 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.

- 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.

- 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.

Finally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with price 5. So the total number of orders = 1999999991, which is equal to 999999984 % (109 + 7).

1810,Minimum Path Cost in a Hidden Grid,"This is an interactive problem.

There is a robot in a hidden grid, and you are trying to get it from its starting cell to the target cell in this grid. The grid is of size `m x n`, and each cell in the grid is either empty or blocked. It is guaranteed that the starting cell and the target cell are different, and neither of them is blocked.

Each cell has a cost that you need to pay each time you move to the cell. The starting cell's cost is not applied before the robot moves.

You want to find the minimum total cost to move the robot to the target cell. However, you do not know the grid's dimensions, the starting cell, nor the target cell. You are only allowed to ask queries to the `GridMaster` object.

The `GridMaster` class has the following functions:
`boolean canMove(char direction)` Returns `true` if the robot can move in that direction. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

`int move(char direction)` Moves the robot in that direction and returns the cost of moving to that cell. If this move would move the robot to a blocked cell or off the grid, the move will be ignored, the robot will remain in the same position, and the function will return `-1`.

`boolean isTarget()` Returns `true` if the robot is currently on the target cell. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Note that `direction` in the above functions should be a character from `{'U','D','L','R'}`, representing the directions up, down, left, and right, respectively.

Return the minimum total cost to get the robot from its initial starting cell to the target cell. If there is no valid path between the cells, return `-1`.

Custom testing:
The test input is read as a 2D matrix `grid` of size `m x n` and four integers `r1`, `c1`, `r2`, and `c2` where:
`grid[i][j] == 0` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is blocked.

`grid[i][j] >= 1` indicates that the cell `(i, j)` is empty and `grid[i][j]` is the cost to move to that cell.

`(r1, c1)` is the starting cell of the robot.

`(r2, c2)` is the target cell of the robot.

Remember that you will not have this information in your code.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [[2,3],[1,1]], r1 = 0, c1 = 1, r2 = 1, c2 = 0
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible interaction is described below:
The robot is initially standing on cell (0, 1), denoted by the 3.

- master.canMove('U') returns false.

- master.canMove('D') returns true.

- master.canMove('L') returns true.

- master.canMove('R') returns false.

- master.move('L') moves the robot to the cell (0, 0) and returns 2.

- master.isTarget() returns false.

Two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2` are similar if it is possible to insert an arbitrary sentence (possibly empty) inside one of these sentences such that the two sentences become equal. For example, `sentence1 = ""Hello my name is Jane""` and `sentence2 = ""Hello Jane""` can be made equal by inserting `""my name is""` between `""Hello""` and `""Jane""` in `sentence2`.

Given two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2`, return `true` if `sentence1` and `sentence2` are similar. Otherwise, return `false`.


Example 1:
Input: sentence1 = ""My name is Haley"", sentence2 = ""My Haley""

They have a rule where they must serve all of the donuts of a batch before serving any donuts of the next batch. You are given an integer `batchSize` and an integer array `groups`, where `groups[i]` denotes that there is a group of `groups[i]` customers that will visit the shop. Each customer will get exactly one donut.

When a group visits the shop, all customers of the group must be served before serving any of the following groups. A group will be happy if they all get fresh donuts. That is, the first customer of the group does not receive a donut that was left over from the previous group.

You are given a sentence `s`​​​​​​ and an integer `k`​​​​​​. You want to truncate `s`​​​​​​ such that it contains only the first `k`​​​​​​ words. Return `s`​​​​​​ after truncating it.


Example 1:
Input: s = ""Hello how are you Contestant"", k = 4
Output: ""Hello how are you""
Explanation:
The words in s are [""Hello"", ""how"" ""are"", ""you"", ""Contestant""].

The first 4 words are [""Hello"", ""how"", ""are"", ""you""].

Hence, you should return ""Hello how are you"".


Example 2:

Multiple users can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform multiple actions in the same minute.

The user active minutes (UAM) for a given user is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.

You are to calculate a 1-indexed array `answer` of size `k` such that, for each `j` (`1 <= j <= k`), `answer[j]` is the number of users whose UAM equals `j`.

Return the array `answer` as described above.


Example 1:
Input: logs = [[0,5],[1,2],[0,2],[0,5],[1,3]], k = 5
Output: [0,2,0,0,0]
Explanation:
The user with ID=0 performed actions at minutes 5, 2, and 5 again. Hence, they have a UAM of 2 (minute 5 is only counted once).

The user with ID=1 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.

Since both users have a UAM of 2, answer[2] is 2, and the remaining answer[j] values are 0.


Example 2:
Input: logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3]], k = 4
Output: [1,1,0,0]
Explanation:
The user with ID=1 performed a single action at minute 1. Hence, they have a UAM of 1.

The user with ID=2 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.

There is one user with a UAM of 1 and one with a UAM of 2.

1818,Minimum Absolute Sum Difference,"You are given two positive integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, both of length `n`.

The absolute sum difference of arrays `nums1` and `nums2` is defined as the sum of `|nums1[i] - nums2[i]|` for each `0 <= i < n` (0-indexed).

You can replace at most one element of `nums1` with any other element in `nums1` to minimize the absolute sum difference.

Return the minimum absolute sum difference after replacing at most one element in the array `nums1`. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.

`|x|` is defined as:
`x` if `x >= 0`, or
`-x` if `x < 0`.


Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,7,5], nums2 = [2,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are two possible optimal solutions:
- Replace the second element with the first: [1,7,5] => [1,1,5], or
- Replace the second element with the third: [1,7,5] => [1,5,5].

Both will yield an absolute sum difference of `|1-2| + (|1-3| or |5-3|) + |5-5| = `3.


Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [2,4,6,8,10], nums2 = [2,4,6,8,10]
Output: 0
Explanation: nums1 is equal to nums2 so no replacement is needed. This will result in an 
absolute sum difference of 0.


Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [1,10,4,4,2,7], nums2 = [9,3,5,1,7,4]
Output: 20
Explanation: Replace the first element with the second: [1,10,4,4,2,7] => [10,10,4,4,2,7].

The rules of the game are as follows:
Start at the `1st` friend.

Count the next `k` friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you started at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once.

The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game.

If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step `2` starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat.

For example, if `obstacles[2] == 1`, then there is an obstacle on lane 1 at point 2.

The frog can only travel from point `i` to point `i + 1` on the same lane if there is not an obstacle on the lane at point `i + 1`. To avoid obstacles, the frog can also perform a side jump to jump to another lane (even if they are not adjacent) at the same point if there is no obstacle on the new lane.
